This repository contains the official code of **OHR-Bench**, a benchmark designed to evaluate the cascading impact of OCR on RAG.

# Overview
- **PDF, gt structured data and Q&A datasets: [[ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opendatalab/OHR-Bench)] `data/pdfs`, `data/ground_truth_structured_data` and `data/qas`**. It includes 4000+ unstructured PDF pages from various domains, including Textbook, Law, Finance, Newspaper, Manual and Academia and Q&A datasets sourced from multimodal document elements. Each PDF page is equipped with a human-verified ground truth structured data.
- **Perturbed data with OCR errors: [[ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opendatalab/OHR-Bench)] `data/perturbed_structured_data`**. In order to conduct in-depth analysis of the OCR's impact on RAG, OHR-Bench identifies *Semantic Noise* and *Formatting Noise* and introduce them with mild, moderate and severe perturbation based on real-world OCR errors.
- **Evaluation framework: [[Github opendatalab/OHR-Bench](https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench)]**. We provide a RAG evaluation framework to assess the impact of OCR processed structured data and our perturbed data on RAG including retrieval, generation and overall performance.

## Evaluation Results
![img.png](./figs/results.png)

We evaluate the suitability of current OCR solutions for real-world RAG applications by conducting comprehensive experiments with our OHR-Bench.
We derive conclusions as follows:

- Pipeline-based OCR demonstrates the best performance. Employing Marker achieves the best retrieval performance across all OCR solutions, while MinerU dominates the generation and overall evaluation.
- All OCR solutions suffer performance degradation. Even the best solutions show a decrease of 1.9 in EM@1 and 2.93 F1@1 in the overall evaluation, with greater losses in the retrieval and generation stages.

# Getting Started
## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset preparation
### OCR processed structured data
To evaluate your OCR results using this benchmark, place the parsed structured data (PDFs can be found at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opendatalab/OHR-Bench)) in the `data/retrieval_base` directory. Use the ground truth (gt) data as an example. The sub-folder names indicate the domain of the parsed results, and each JSON file, named as the same of corresponding PDF files, should contain the corresponding parsed results.

<details>
<summary>Directory Structure</summary>

```bash
retrieval_base/gt/ # We provide gt and MinerU processed structured data as illustration here
â”œâ”€â”€ finance # Domain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 3M_2023Q2_10Q.json # Parsed results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ textbook
...
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>OCR Processed Data</summary>

```json
[
    {
        "page_idx": "finance/JPMORGAN_2021Q1_10Q", // Page index
        "text": "...", // OCR processed structured data
    },
    ...
]
```

</details>

### QA data
The qa data is placed in `data/qas.json`. Each JSON file should be structured as follows:

<details>
<summary>Q&A JSON</summary>

```json
[
    {
        "doc_name": "finance/JPMORGAN_2021Q1_10Q", // Document source
        "ID": "00073cc2-c801-467c-9039-fca63c78c6a9", // Unique ID
        "questions": "What was the total amount of nonaccrual loans retained as of March 31, 2021?",
        "answers": "842",
        "doc_type": "finance", // Q&A domain.
        "answer_form": "Numeric", // Answer format.
        "evidence_source": "table", // Evidence source.
        "evidence_context": "Nonaccrual loans retained $^{(\\mathrm{a})}$ & \\$ & 842 & \\$ & 689 & $22 \\%$", // Evidence.
        "evidence_page_no": 24
    },
    ...
]
```

</details>


## LLMs preparation
In `src/configs`, configure your local LLM path or GPT API.
```python
GPT_api_key = 'You KEY Here'  # openai.api_key
...
Qwen2_7B_local_path = 'Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct' # download from Hugging Face or your local path
```


# Run Evaluation
To evaluate your OCR results, follow the instructions in the Dataset Preparation section to organize your OCR data.

```bash
# The first argument specifies which OCR results to use for evaluation.
# The second argument specifies the retrievers or LLMs.

# Generation
bash shell/generation.sh gt qwen2_7b
# Retrieval
bash shell/retrieval.sh gt qwen2_7b
# End-to-end
bash shell/end2end.sh gt qwen2_7b
```
