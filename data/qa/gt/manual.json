During the measurement, the wrist is pressed by the airbag, which may result in the blood flow to your fingertips slowing down and cause blood stasis. In this case, take off your watch, raise your arm high, and repeatedly make a fist and open it for about 15 times.\n\nThe blood pressure measured at home is different from that measured at the hospital\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is lower than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:\n- You feel more stressed at the hospital, resulting in the blood pressure higher than it should be.\nYou have greater peace of mind and your body is more relaxed at home, sometimes resulting in the blood pressure lower than that measured at the hospital.\n- The measurement results will be lower if the measurement position is above the heart.\nThe measurement results may be lower if your wrist is above your heart during the measurement.\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is higher than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:",

An authenticated request must include a signature. The signature is calculated based on the requester's access keys (a pair of AK and SK) that are used as the encryption factor and the specific information included in the request body. OBS uses an access key ID (AK) and a secret access key (SK) together to authenticate the identity of a requester.

You'll be asked to provide additional details about your order by choosing several options. The first two, order type and start date, are worth careful consideration.\n\nSingle Orders vs. Standing Orders\nFor a one-time delivery of names, choose a single order. To receive several batches of names matching the same criteria, choose a standing order.\n\nSingle Orders\nThe single order is the simplest option. If you choose an immediate start date, you'll be provided with an actual count of students who meet your criteria. This count shows the correct number after the search results have been deduplicated against your processed orders. However, the count does not include deduplication against prior orders that have been built or submitted, but not processed.\n\nWith a single order, you're likely to miss students who meet your criteria but test later than your start date. You can view an estimated count of those students by changing your start date or changing your order type to a standing order.\n\nStanding Orders\nWith a standing order, the system does the work for you. You'll receive an initial list of student names plus new names meeting the same criteria throughout the time period you specify. You set the start date, the maximum number of names, the end date and the frequency with which you'd like to receive additional names.\n\nIf you choose an immediate start date, you'll see two counts: an actual count of student names available right away (deduplicated against prior, processed orders) and an estimate of names available in the future.\nYou won't know with certainty the total number of student names you'll receive. And once your order has been processed, it will continue to run automatically - you won't be able to adjust your criteria.\n\nStart Date Options\nWhether you choose a single order or a standing order, you have three options for starting your order.\nImmediate Start Date\nIf, judging by the name count, College Board Search already has the student names you need, choose an immediate start date and submit your order.\n\nImmediate Start Date with Delayed Submission\nChoosing an immediate start date but waiting to submit your order can help you manage your time and your resources. Create the order when you have the time to strategize and to craft an effective search, but wait to submit it if the name count is low or if you expect new names meeting your criteria to be loaded in the future.\nWhen you're ready to submit your order, you can check the final deduplicated name count and adjust criteria as needed.\n\nFuture Start Date\nTo submit the order now but delay processing, choose a custom date or a date when new data becomes available. For instance, you might want to place an SAT order in October but delay it until the December SAT data is loaded in January. Your order will be among the first processed when new data is loaded.\n\nIf you choose a future start date, you'll see two counts: the actual number of names available immediately and an estimate of the total volume. This estimate is likely to be high since it won't be deduplicated. Deduplication is impossible because student names for future assessments won't have been loaded yet. You won't be able to adjust your criteria after you've placed the order.\n<Previous section\nhttps://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/quick-start-guide/name-licenses\n$1 / 1$",

You'll be taken to the Search for Students home page. Start the name-licensing process by clicking the orange Start new search button. You'll be taken to the Select Criteria section.\n\nIf you've saved searches recently, you can access them from the Search for Students home page in the left column. You can also access searches you've defined as top searches.\n\nBuild Your List\nTo build a list of names from the College Board Search database, select the criteria that best describe the students you're looking for. Start by choosing the graduating classes you're interested in; you must choose at least one class (or include all) before moving on to other criteria. If you subscribe to Enrollment Planning Service as well as Student Search Service, you'll see two options here: Research \\& license and Research only. Be sure to choose Research \\& license if your goal is to license names.\n\nOnce you've selected graduating classes, the number of available students will display in the right column. As you continue to define your student list, that number will change to reflect the volume of students who meet your criteria.\n\nOther criteria describing students include geography, College Board exams, demographics, academic performance and extracurricular participation, intended major, address preferences and college preferences.\n\nYou can select criteria in any order \u2014 and you don't have to select criteria from every category. Get more tips in Power Searching.\n\nVisualize Your List\nFind out if the list you're building meets your needs by clicking View Dashboard at any point and using the three data visualization tabs: Overview, Map and Custom Charts. The Overview displays charts and tables profiling the population you've defined, while the Map displays their geographic distribution. Use Custom Charts to create pie charts, bar charts and cross-tab charts representing self-selected characteristics of the students in your list. They'll help you to understand your list better and to make your point in presentations and reports.\nUse all three features to help you decide if you need to adjust your list before placing an order. Learn more in Customize Results.\n\nLicense Names\nWhen you're ready to place your order, click Submit Order to provide additional details about your order. You'll be asked to choose:\n\nThe type of order (single or standing)\nA start date\nA maximum number of names\nAn end date, if placing a standing order\nThe frequency of updates, if placing a standing order\nFile recipients\nOutput settings\nBilling options\nFor help deciding on a start date and choosing between a single and a standing order, go to Name Licenses.\n< Previous section\nhttps://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/quick-start-guide/introduction-to-college-board-search/student-search-service-esse...\n1/1",

Start by choosing the graduating classes you're interested in; you must choose at least one class (or include all) before moving on to other criteria. If you subscribe to Enrollment Planning Service as well as Student Search Service, you'll see two options here: Research \\& license and Research only. Be sure to choose Research \\& license if your goal is to license names.\n\nOnce you've selected graduating classes, the number of available students will display in the right column. As you continue to define your student list, that number will change to reflect the volume of students who meet your criteria.\n\nOther criteria describing students include geography, College Board exams, demographics, academic performance and extracurricular participation, intended major, address preferences and college preferences.\n\nYou can select criteria in any order \u2014 and you don't have to select criteria from every category. Get more tips in Power Searching.\n\nVisualize Your List\nFind out if the list you're building meets your needs by clicking View Dashboard at any point and using the three data visualization tabs: Overview, Map and Custom Charts. The Overview displays charts and tables profiling the population you've defined, while the Map displays their geographic distribution. Use Custom Charts to create pie charts, bar charts and cross-tab charts representing self-selected characteristics of the students in your list. They'll help you to understand your list better and to make your point in presentations and reports.\nUse all three features to help you decide if you need to adjust your list before placing an order. Learn more in Customize Results.\n\nLicense Names\nWhen you're ready to place your order, click Submit Order to provide additional details about your order. You'll be asked to choose:\n\nThe type of order (single or standing)\nA start date\nA maximum number of names\nAn end date, if placing a standing order\nThe frequency of updates, if placing a standing order\nFile recipients\nOutput settings\nBilling options\nFor help deciding on a start date and choosing between a single and a standing order, go to Name Licenses.\n< Previous section\nhttps://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/quick-start-guide/introduction-to-college-board-search/student-search-service-esse...\n1/1",

To create an effective search, take some time to strategize first.\n\nStrategy\n\nConsider these questions:\nWhat goal does this search serve?\nWhich students do I want to communicate with?\nWhat message do I want to send?\nThe answers will guide you as you select criteria that will include the students you aspire to enroll and eliminate the students unlikely to enroll. For instance, if your goal is to increase diversity, the ethnicity criterion in demographics will be a strategy driver. If your goal is to increase applications from female students of color interested in engineering, the gender criterion in demographics and the intended majors criterion will be additional strategy drivers.\n\nNote that many data fields are available in revised Student Search Service ${ }^{\\circledR}$ data layout. You'll be able to identify the students you want to reach and segment your communication appropriately.\n\nGraduating Class\n\nBefore you choose demographic or other criteria, however, you'll choose a graduating class. Juniors and some sophomore take the PSAT/NMSQT, all other sophomores will take the PSAT 10 in the spring. While you can send the same message to sophomores and juniors, consider their different perspectives on the college selection process and the different messages that are likely to resonate with each grade level.\n\nOnce you decide which class or classes to recruit, build the order in a way that lets you communicate the right message to the right group of students.\n\nNew Prospects\n\nIf you don't choose otherwise, your search results will be deduplicated. In other words, you can be certain your order will not include student names included in previously processed orders. If you license names of both sophomore and junior PSAT/NMSQT takers, you will not receive duplicate records for students who tested as sophomores and again as juniors. However, deduplication is not always the best choice.\n\nYou might wish to change the New prospects setting to Include all students if your goal is to reach out to all likely National Merit scholars. Students qualify for this scholarship by testing in their junior year, so a student who scores well as a junior, and whose name you may have already received as part of a sophomore search the year before, would not be part of a deduplicated search.\n\nAnother instance when deduplication might be inappropriate is when you want to send a specific message to a particular group. For example, if you want your coach to reach out to women lacrosse players, deduplicating the order would yield only those students who have never received any communication from your institution.\n\nCollege Board Exams\n\nUse the College Board Exams section to limit your results to all or some PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10 takers within the cohorts you selected. Consider limiting your search to students likely to succeed at your institution by choosing specific score bands. Get more information on searching by exam criteria.\n\nOther Criteria\n\nAs you make other criteria selections to focus your search on the students most likely to apply to your institution and meet your enrollment goals, make sure you don't narrow it so drastically that you miss out on students who might be a good fit. Remember that many data points are collected from SAT takers only and are not available for PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10 takers. Choosing these will limit your results to students who have also taken the SAT.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nWatch the student name count in the upper-right corner of your screen to spot any significant drops.\nLook out for warnings about SAT-only criteria.\nTo see which data is collected from which test-takers, view the Student-Data-By-Exam table.\n\nView Dashboard and Submit Order\n\nOnce you've built your search, click View Dashboard to evaluate it and ensure that it meets your needs.

Take out all removable parts, wrap them well, and tape them together so they don't shift and rattle.\n9. Screw in the leveling rollers.\n10. Tape the doors shut and tape the power supply cord to the cabinet.\nWhen you get to your new home, put everything back and refer to page 6. Also, remember to reconnect the water supply line.\n\n\nPower interruptions\n\n\nIf electricity goes off, call the power company. Ask how long power will be off.\n1. If service will be interrupted 24 hours or less, keep both doors closed. This helps foods stay frozen.\n2. If service will be interrupted longer than 24 hours:\n(a) Remove all frozen food and store in a frozen food locker.\nOR\n(b) Place 32 grams of dry ice in freezer for every liter ( 2 lbs. for every cubic foot) of freezer space.

Then EA/VPP is raised to $+21 \\mathrm{~V}, \\mathrm{ALE} / \\overline{\\mathrm{PROG}}$ is pulsed, and then $E A / V_{P P}$ is returned to a logic high. Waveforms and detailed timing specifications are shown in later sections of this data sheet.\n\nFigure 5. Programming Configuration\n\"VPP\" = + 21V $\\pm 0.5 \\mathrm{~V}$\n*ALE is pulsed low for 50 ms .\n\nNote that the EA/VPP pin must not be allowed to go above the maximum specified VPP level of 21.5 V for any amount of time. Even a narrow glitch above that voltage level can cause permanent damage to the device. The VPP source should be well regulated and free of glitches.\n\nProgram Verification\nIf the Security Bit has not been programmed, the onchip Program Memory can be read out for verification purposes, if desired, either during or after the programming operation. The address of the Program Memory location to be read is applied to Port 1 and pins P2.0-P2.3. The other pins should be held at the \"Verify\" levels indicated in Table 3. The contents of the addressed location will come out on Port 0. External pullups are required on Port 0 for this operation.\n\nThe setup, which is shown in Figure 6, is the same as for programming the EPROM except that pin P2.7 is held at a logic low, or may be used as an activelow read strobe.\n\nFigure 6.

Capacitive loading on Ports 0 and 2 may cause spurious noise pulses to be superimposed on the VOLS of ALE/ $\\overline{\\text { PROG }}$ and Ports 1 and 3 .

In the worst cases (capacitive loading $>100 \\mathrm{pF}$ ), the noise pulse on the ALE/PROG pin may exceed 0.8 V . In such cases it may be desirable to qualify ALE with a Schmitt Trigger, or use an address latch with a Schmitt Trigger STROBE input.\n2. ALE/PROG refers to a pin on the 8751 BH . ALE refers to a timing signal that is output on the ALE/$\\overline{\\text { PROG }}$ pin.\n3.

For those who could not reserve accommodation on-campus, they will need to make their own housing arrangements off campus.

Double rooms are 40 RMB per day and the single and \"AB\" rooms are 80 RMB per day.\nThe dormitories are each equipped with a desk, bed and\ncloset. A mattress, quilt, pillow and bed linen are also provided. There are specific times for the use of hot water for showering in the dormitories, which are as follows: 7:00am - 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm - 12:00am each day.

Each building has its own public spaces for use by students, such as a study lounge, workshop space, multi-purpose room, light sports space (facilities vary from building to building). Also, apart from the $A B$ rooms in building 20 that have a small room kitchen, all buildings have communal kitchens. Students need to use their own cooking utensils and supplies. All buildings are equipped with public washing machines, and some buildings also have dryers.\n\nAccording to school regulations, the Zijing Apartment Buildings $19-23$ are for international students. Friends or family members are allowed to visit, but they must first register at the reception desk on the ground floor of the building after presenting their valid ID document. Guests are not permitted to stay overnight, and can visit between the hours of 8:00am and 11:00pm.\n\nStudents residing in the dormitories must abide by the dormitory rules and regulations stipulated in the Tsinghua University Administrative Measures for International Student Dormitory Accommodation. The measures include that that smoking indoors and the use of cooking appliances in areas other than the common kitchens are prohibited in the apartment buildings, and that the following objects are prohibited for being used or stored in the apartments: electric vehicle batteries and chargers (including scooter batteries), immersion heaters, electric blankets, electric water heaters, electric heaters or open flames such as candles. In the event of illegal residence in the apartment, the charging of electric vehicle batteries, non-residents staying in the apartment ovemight, or the use of prohibited electrical appliances of the causing of a fire, the student's right to accommodation will be forfeit.\n\nOff-Campus Living\nDue to the limited amount of on-campus accommodation, some students will need to find accommodation off campus. Students who do not have a dormitory room reserved on campus can choose to rent an apartment off campus. Before moving in to any off-campus accommodation, it should be checked whether the landlord can provide the documentation required for the issuing of a Registration Form of Temporary Residence ( \u4e34\u65f6\u4f4f\u5bbf\u767b\u8bb0\u8868).\n\nThere are many housing agencies located near the Tsinghua campus.
