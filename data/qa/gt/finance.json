        "answers": "AA+",
        "context": "Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held non-traded financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\n\nInvestment securities risk\n\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was $\\$ 595.4$ billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for further information on related liquidity risk.\n\nPrincipal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately held nontraded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm's business strategies. The Firm's investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm's commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. The Firm's principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios have not been significantly affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainties remain that could result in future negative impacts.\nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n  (in billions) & \\begin{tabular}{r} \nMarch 31, \\\\\n2021\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{r} \nDecember 31, \\\\\n2020\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nTax-oriented investments (e.g., \\\\\naffordable housing and alternative \\\\\nenergy investments)\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \nPrivate equity, various debt and \\\\\nequity instruments, and real assets\n\\end{tabular} & $\\$$ & $\\mathbf{1 9 . 5}$ & $\\$$ & 20.0 \\\\\n  Total carrying value & $\\$$ & $\\mathbf{2 5 . 8}$ & $\\$$ & 26.2 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

India's Enforcement Directorate (\"ED\") is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (\"Amrapali\"). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers' petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\"PMLA\") and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\"FEMA\"). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $\\$ 25$ million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing.

Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (\"FRN\") commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $\\$ 875$ million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.\n(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $\\$ 7.0$ billion and $\\$ 3.6$ billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm's standards.\n\nGains and losses on sales of loans\n\nNet gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $\\$ 132$ million, of which $\\$ 135$ million related to loans. Net losses on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $\\$(913)$ million, of which $\\$(142)$ million related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.\n\nLoan modifications\n\nThe Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm's COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because:\n- they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm's regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or\n- the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.",

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone $100 \\%$ minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm's reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of $100 \\%$.

Deposits continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm's reported LCR under the LCR rule.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.\n\nOther liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$ 841$ billion and $\\$ 740$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$ 301$ billion and $\\$ 307$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n\nNSFR\n\nThe net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of \"available\" and \"required\" amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least $100 \\%$ on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\nThe Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100\\% minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final rule.",

The increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm's reported LCR under the LCR rule.\n\nThe Firm's average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.\n\nOther liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $\\$ 841$ billion and $\\$ 740$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased deposits.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $\\$ 301$ billion and $\\$ 307$ billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n\nNSFR\n\nThe net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of \"available\" and \"required\" amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least $100 \\%$ on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\nThe Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100\\% minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based on its current understanding of the final rule.",

Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new TDRs were $\\$ 115$ million and $\\$ 233$ million, respectively.

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm's allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\n150",

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan's allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan's expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with the First Republic acquisition.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\n\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $\\$ 0$ to approximately $\\$ 1.3$ billion at June 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n- the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n- the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\n- the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\n- the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\n\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.\n\n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (\"1MDB\"), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges \"dishonest assistance\" against J.P.

In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court's jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim against J.P.

In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers' petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $\\$ 31.5$ million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\"PMLA\") and Foreign Exchange Management Act (\"FEMA\").

The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (\"FX\") sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law.

Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm's securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance\nsheet presentation.

The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the sale of Verizon Media in the current period, partially offset by the nonrecurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of legal entity restructurings. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in the current period.\n\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nConsolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n\nConsolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below, are non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon's competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses to net income.\n\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company's operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See \"Special Items\" for additional information.\n\nIt is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis",

We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company's operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes, and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 million prepaid connections, which include approximately 20 million Consumer prepaid connections due to the Tracfone acquisition. Approximately 79\\% of our Consumer wireless retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2021.\n\nWe offer various postpaid and prepaid service plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered domestic and/or international voice, data, and texting; the ability to share data allowances and/or use data allowances in different periods; high definition voice and video features; premium content; the ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Our service offerings vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.\n\nAccess to the internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.\n\nWe no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for devices; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.\n\n\nWireless Equipment\n\n\nConsumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches. We permit customers to acquire equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to pay for the device in installments over time.\n\nVerizon Consumer Group\n\nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. Consumer also provides non-connectivity services including device protection, cloud storage, and other products.\n\nResidential Fixed Services. We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our $100 \\%$ fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio, and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. As of December 31, 2021, fifth-generation (5G) fixed wireless technology for the home ( 5 GHome ) is available in parts of 65 U.S. cities. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Home fixed wireless access internet service is available in parts of all 50 states across the United States.\n\nWe offer residential fixed services tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our services may include features related to, among other things: internet access at different speed tiers using fiber-optic, copper or wireless technology; video services that may feature a variety of channel options, video on demand products, cloud-based services and digital video recording capabilities; over-the-top video services; voice services; and other home solutions.\n\nNetwork Access Services. We sell network access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on a wholesale basis, who in turn resell wireless service under their own brand(s) to consumers. Our largest such arrangement was with Tracfone, until we acquired Tracfone from Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil in November 2021.\n\nVerizon Business Group\n\nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, our Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long-distance voice services and network access to deliver various Io T services and products.\n\nSmall and Medium Business\n\nSmall and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, conferencing services, tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, advanced voice solutions and security and managed information technology (IT) services to our U.S.-based small and medium businesses that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise, as described below. In 2021, Small and Medium Business revenues were $\\$ 11.8$ billion, representing approximately $38 \\%$ of Business's total revenues.\n\nIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Small and Medium Business provides fixed connectivity solutions comparable to the residential fixed services provided by Consumer, as well as business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case with features and pricing designed to address the needs of small and medium businesses.",

        "context": "Certain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were $\\$ 808$ million and $\\$ 402$ million, respectively.

We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while building momentum for our 5G network. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network that enable efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements.\n\nThe U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry. We expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables, tablets and IoT devices. We expect 5 G technology will provide a significant opportunity for growth in the industry in 2022 and beyond. With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT\\&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider's voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.\n\nWith respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. These service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.\n\nWe expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans, driven in part by attractive bundled content with premium brands, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services, increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems.

        "questions": "What is the approach used to estimate the fair value of wireless licenses in the quantitative impairment assessment?",
        "answers": "Greenfield approach",
        "context": "Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization\n\n\nA significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network.\n\nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years.\n\nAs part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, projections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole, as well as other factors. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.\n\nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized.\n\nInterest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.\n\nWireless licenses can be purchased through public auctions conducted by the FCC. Deposits required to participate in these auctions and purchase licenses are recorded within Deposits for wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets until the corresponding licenses are received and within Net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets\n\nOur intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.\n\nSee Note 4 for information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other acquired intangible assets.\n\nLeases\n\nWe lease network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate, connectivity mediums which include dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations under both operating and finance leases. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception.

Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.

        "context": "Broadband\n\n\nVerizon offers many different broadband services. The FCC currently recognizes broadband internet access services as \"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. However, the FCC could return to a more utilities-style regulation of broadband. Additionally, a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of those cases related to regulations in California and Vermont are being litigated in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. Our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadbandcommitment.\n\nWireline Voice\n\nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.\n\nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon's telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated.\n\nVideo\n\nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.\n\nPrivacy and Data Security\n\nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence and IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product or service. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally, and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.\n\nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity\n\nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, the California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities.\n\nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access\n\nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate.\n\nRegulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state and local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the world's population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, including telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the crisis and the governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict.",

Although some of these have been challenged in court, the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain.\n- \"Open Access\" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.\n- Climate-Related Regulation and Policy - Due to the nature of our operations, we may be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.\n\nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.\n\n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\n\n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nVerizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Verizon had approximately $\\$ 136.7$ billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $\\$ 9.4$ billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $\\$ 14.2$ billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon's debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n- requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;\n- making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;\n- reducing Verizon's flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions;\n- making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n- exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates.\n\nAdverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.\n\nWe require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.

A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.\n\nIncreases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.\n\nWith approximately 118,400 employees, including approximately 800 Tracfone employees, and approximately 187,000 retirees as of December 31, 2021 eligible to participate in Verizon's benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits",

Stock-Based Compensation\n\n\nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn May 2017, Verizon's shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 76 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements on the annual grant date.\n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nPerformance Stock Units\n\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award.

        "context": "remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.\n\n\nNote 10. Stock-Based Compensation\n\n\nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn May 2017, Verizon's shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 76 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements on the annual grant date.\n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nPerformance Stock Units\n\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award.

        "questions": "How is the revenue recognized for overage usage in postpaid wireless service plans for Verizon?",
        "answers": "The overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services, and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).",
        "context": "We also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.\n\n\nNature of Products and Services\n\n\nTelecommunications\n\nService\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\nEquipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 24 or 30 -month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixedterm and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold through the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel.\n\nWireless Contracts\n\nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price of the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.\n\nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee liability was $\\$ 77$ million and insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee, which is accounted for outside the scope of Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.",

        "context": "Other\n\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we completed various other acquisitions for cash consideration of approximately $\\$ 51$ million and $\\$ 127$ million, respectively.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in the Complex Media business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\\$ 131$ million in Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, Verizon entered into an agreement to sell our Huffington Post business. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $\\$ 126$ million in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction closed in February 2021.\n\nNote 4. Wireless Licenses, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWireless Licenses\nThe carrying amounts of Wireless licenses, as well as wireless spectrum for which licenses had not yet been received, are as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr} \n& & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{ (dollars in millions) } \\\\\nAt December 31, & $\\mathbf{2 0 2 1}$ & 2020 \\\\\n  Wireless licenses & $\\mathbf{1 4 7 , 6 1 9}$ & $\\$$ & 96,097 \\\\\n  Deposits for wireless licenses & - & 2,772\n\\end{tabular}\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately $\\$ 54.9$ billion and $\\$ 6.4$ billion, respectively, of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which we were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $\\$ 1.6$ billion and $\\$ 242$ million of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn July 2021, we received the wireless licenses won in connection with the FCC's auction for C-Band wireless spectrum, Auction 107. As a result, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying activities that occurred, were reclassified from Deposits for wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 3 for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified substantially all of our 39 GHz wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, with a carrying value of $\\$ 2.8$ billion to assets held for sale in connection with the FCC's incentive auction, Auction 103. As a result, these wireless licenses were adjusted down to their fair value of $\\$ 1.6$ billion resulting in a pre-tax loss of $\\$ 1.2$ billion ( $\\$ 914$ million after-tax) in 2020. The new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and had a value of $\\$ 3.4$ billion. See Note 3 for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we renewed various wireless licenses in accordance with FCC regulations with an average renewal period of 11 years and 10 years, respectively. See Note 1 for additional information.\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In 2021, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses as of the test date. In 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount.

Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nPrior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management's expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management's assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.\n\nWe pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of \"new customers\" and \"existing customers.\" New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.\n\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management's qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.\n\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. However, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired. Subsequent to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as management's expectations of conditions in the future, if applicable. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management's assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.\n\nWe pool our device payment plan agreement receivables based on the credit quality indicators and shared risk characteristics of \"new customers\" and \"existing customers.\" New customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for less than 210 days. Existing customers are defined as customers who have been with Verizon for 210 days or more. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance.\n\nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management's qualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above.\n\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

        "answers": "one year",
        "context": "Warranties and Indemnities\n\n\nThe Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products.\n\nChanges in the Company's estimated liability for product warranty during 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  \\multirow[t]{2}{*}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { December 31, } \\\\\n& 2022\n\\end{aligned}$$} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { December } 25 \\text {, } \\\\\n& 2021\n\\end{aligned}$$} \\\\\n  & \\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{(In millions)} \\\\\n  Beginning balance & \\$ & 51 & \\$ & 37 \\\\\n  Provisions during the period & & 115 & & 106 \\\\\n  Settlements during the period & & (101) & & (92) \\\\\n  Ending balance & \\$ & 65 & \\$ & 51 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nIn addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company's products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial.\n\nNOTE 17 - Contingencies\n\nQuarterhill Inc. Litigation\n\nOn July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.

As of December 31,2022 , we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $\\$ 8.6$ billion, of which $\\$ 6.5$ billion are in fiscal year 2023 . On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.\n\nWe believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\nOperating Activities\n\nOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.",

We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date.

Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

As of December 31, 2022, $\\$ 6.5$ billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company's employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company's stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan).\n\nUnder the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards.\n\nUnder the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs.\nStock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than $100 \\%$ of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\n\nTime-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company's common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied.\n\nPRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company's senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company's financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from $0 \\%$ to $250 \\%$ of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.",

        "context": "Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the \"demanding party\"). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin.

        "answers": "CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts.",
        "context": "Residential mortgage\n\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.\n\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\n\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (\"controlling class\"). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.\n\nRe-securitizations\n\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSES and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm's consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm's role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\n\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\n\\begin{tabular}{llllll}\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nYear ended December 31, \\\\\n(in millions)\n\\end{tabular} & $\\mathbf{2 0 2 2}$ & 2021 & 2020 \\\\\n  Transfers of securities to VIEs & & & & & \\\\\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \nU.S. GSEs and government \\\\\nagencies\n\\end{tabular} & $\\mathbf{\\$ 1 6 , 1 2 8}$ & $\\mathbf{\\$}$ & $\\mathbf{5 3 , 9 2 3}$ & $\\mathbf{\\$}$ & $\\mathbf{4 6 , 1 2 3}$ \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.",

        "context": "Management's discussion and analysis\n\n\nLending-related commitments\n\nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.\n\nReceivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (\"ETD\"), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (\"OTC-cleared\") derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm's OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily was approximately $87 \\%$ and $88 \\%$ at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$ 70.9$ billion and $\\$ 57.1$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements.\n\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.\nDerivative receivables\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  December 31, (in millions) & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2022} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2021} \\\\\n  Total, net of cash collateral & \\$ & 70,880 & \\$ & 57,081 \\\\\n  Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables & & $(23,014)$ & & $(10,102)$ \\\\\n  Total, net of liquid securities and other cash collateral & \\$ & 47,866 & \\$ & 46,979 \\\\\n  Other collateral held against derivative receivables & & $(1,261)$ & & $(1,544)$ \\\\\n  Total, net of collateral & \\$ & 46,605 & \\$ & 45,435 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",

The Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations' safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm's compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (\"CRD V\"), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies including under CRD $\\vee$ which in certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.\n\nOther significant international regulatory initiatives: Policymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are discussed below.\n\nMiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified trading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission (\"EC\") published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.\nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the \"Wholesale Markets Review\", a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.'s departure from the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (\"FSMB\"), which is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further consultation, which is expected during 2023.",

        "answers": "No downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take place.",
        "context": "Calculation of Performance Ranking\n\n\nFor purposes of the Performance Ranking, the ranking of the Firm and of each Performance Company for the Performance Period shall be determined and calculated by the Calculation Agent, using the definitions of \"Average Tangible Common Equity\" (if otherwise applicable), \"Calculated PSUs\", \"Firm Reported ROTCE\", \"Performance Table\" (including its footnote) and \"ROTCE\" as set forth in the \"Definitions\" section of these terms and conditions. See section captioned \"Definitions\". Except for Firm Reported ROTCE, calculations will be expressed as a decimal to the second place (i.e. xx.yy\\%), rounded to the nearest hundredth. See section captioned, \"Definitions--Performance Table\" in the event of a tie. All performance based calculations as set forth herein are binding and conclusive on you and your successors.\n\nCapital Ratio Performance Threshold\n\nUnvested PSUs are subject to reduction if the Firm's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio at any year end falls below a predetermined threshold of $\\qquad$ $\\%$\n\nIf the Firm's CET1 capital ratio at any year end during the Performance Period is below this predetermined threshold, up to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year.\n\nQualitative Performance\n\nDetermination of Qualitative Performance Factor. Annually during the Performance Period, the Committee will formally assess your qualitative performance based on four broad categories: (1) Client/Customer Focus; (2) Risk, Controls \\& Conduct; (3) Teamwork \\& Leadership; and (4) Business Results. If the Committee determines that your performance \"Meets\" expectations, no downward adjustment to one-third of the Target Award Number of PSUs for that year shall take place (and the Qualitative Performance Factor shall be $100 \\%$ ). If the Committee determines that your performance did \"Not Meet\" expectations, the Committee shall determine whether a downward adjustment is appropriate, and if so, to what extent. A downward adjustment could result in a Qualitative Performance Factor of between 0\\% and $99 \\%$, depending on the circumstances.

The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm's potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum $100 \\%$ dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates $10 \\%$ of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm's interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $\\$ 13.8$ billion and $\\$ 13.7$ billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $\\$ 10.6$ billion and $\\$ 13.4$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n\nMunicipal bond vehicles\n\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (\"TOB\") trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (\"floaters\") and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (\"residuals\"). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider's obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events",

The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm's potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum $100 \\%$ dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates $10 \\%$ of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm's interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $\\$ 13.8$ billion and $\\$ 13.7$ billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $\\$ 10.6$ billion and $\\$ 13.4$ billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n\nMunicipal bond vehicles\n\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (\"TOB\") trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (\"floaters\") and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (\"residuals\"). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider's obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events",

The change to business segment operating income (loss) aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. The changes included the items described below. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\n\nReflecting gains/losses from sale of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated Change\n\n3 M updated its business segment operating performance measure to reflect all gains/losses from sales of PPE and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated. Previously, certain of these gains/losses were included in 3M's business segments' operating performance.\n\nMovement of certain businesses between segments\n\nThe businesses associated with two groups of products (each with approximately $\\$ 25$ million in sales) were realigned with one moving from the Consumer business segment to the Health Care business segment and the other moving from the Health Care business segment to the Consumer business segment.\n\nAlso effective in the first quarter of 2023, the Consumer business segment re-aligned from four divisions to the following three divisions: Home, Health and Auto Care; Construction and Home Improvement Markets; and Stationery and Office.",

        "context": "3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025.3 M 's decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations. The Company recognized a $\\$ 0.8$ billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with this announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with its exit activities. In addition, these two announced actions (the \"exit\") involve risks, including the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the Company's ability to complete such exit, on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to PFAS manufacturing and production, or the Company's exit plans; the Company's ability to identify and manufacture acceptable substitutes for the discontinued products, and the possibility that such substitutes will not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the Company's exit plans; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, or otherwise have negative impacts on the Company's relationships with its customers and other counterparties.\n\n3 M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions.

In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a proposed class-action settlement (\"Settlement\") to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States regarding any PFAS, subject to court approval.

        "context": "In Delaware, 3M, is defending one putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case was removed to federal court, and in September 2022, the court dismissed all but plaintiffs' negligence claim. Plaintiffs have filed a third amended complaint which 3M moved to dismiss in December 2022. This motion has been fully briefed and is pending the court decision.\n\nIn New Jersey, 3 M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, a publicly traded water utility serving customers in and around certain portions of Middlesex County, New Jersey, which alleges PFAS contamination of its water system. The Court denied 3M's motion for summary judgment in October 2022 and a trial date has been set for October 2, 2023. The parties are exploring potential resolution in advance of trial. In September 2020, 3 M was named a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the Pequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is scheduled to commence in June 2023 (Hopatcong) and July 2023 (Pequannock).\n\n3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 27 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3 M . These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. 3 M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in ten cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3M's share is not considered material. Plaintiffs in the 17 remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their disabled adult children. In July 2022, plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against defendants other than 3 M , which motion was denied by the court. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of these cases. In December 2022, an additional personal injury case was filed in New Jersey State court.\n\n3 M and Middlesex Water Company are also defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November 2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFAS. The court denied 3M's motion to dismiss, and the case is proceeding through discovery. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative class action of the state residents who are customers of the water company, seeking indemnity from the Company. After Middlesex Water Company removed the case to federal court in July 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. The federal court remanded the case back to state court in April 2023 and 3M has since answered the third-party complaint. In March 2023, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M by another Middlesex Water Company customer. In May 2023, 3M filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims in that lawsuit.\n\nIn South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges property damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey \\& Lord plant from 1966 until 2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in December 2022, which 3M has moved to dismiss.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by local paper manufacturing facilities. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of Westminster. This case was removed to federal court. In February 2023, the federal court consolidated this action with a previously-filed federal case involving similar allegations and claims against 3M's co-defendants. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting claims against 3 M . 3 M filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in March 2023.\n\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as defendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills. The lawsuit seeks to recover for alleged property damage. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint limiting the scope of their claims to allegations pertaining to one paper mill and three defendants that allegedly supplied PFAS-containing products to that mill, including 3 M . 3 M has moved to dismiss this case.",

Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting claims against 3 M . 3 M filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in March 2023.\n\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as defendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills. The lawsuit seeks to recover for alleged property damage. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint limiting the scope of their claims to allegations pertaining to one paper mill and three defendants that allegedly supplied PFAS-containing products to that mill, including 3 M . 3 M has moved to dismiss this case.",

        "context": "Environmental Matters and Litigation\n\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, many for which private parties in the United States and abroad have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\n\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\") and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination. Please refer to the section entitled \"Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\" that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\")), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (\"PFOA\"), perfluorooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\"), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (\"PFHxS\"), perfluorobutane sulfonate (\"PFBS\"), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (\"HFPO-DA\") and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, \"PFAS\").\n\nAs a result of a phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008 . The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to PFBS. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company's policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025.3M's decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.\n\nPFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\n\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues, including if regulations become final and enforceable, 3 M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M's reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.",

Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non-3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. Plaintiffs in both the federal and state individual cases assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. A mediation involving plaintiffs from 32 of the federal and state cases and all of the defendants was held in April 2023. 3M and certain of the other defendants have agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs involved in the mediation, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3M's share is not considered material. These cases will continue to move forward as to certain remaining defendants, and the other remaining cases continue. Additionally, 3 M is defending a case in New York state court filed by the Town of Petersburgh in September 2022. Plaintiff alleges that 3 M and several other manufacturers contributed to PFOA contamination in the town's public water supply. Oral argument on a motion to dismiss that was filed by 3 M and the other defendants is scheduled for July 2023. 3M is also defending 22 individual cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers, including 9 new complaints filed on behalf of additional water districts during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3 M , DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. 3 M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine. The action arose from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M's product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. 3 M and Wolverine agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs, and 3M's share is not considered material; the court approved the class settlement in March 2023 and 3M's final payment related to the settlement was made in June 2023.\n\nIn Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending two state court cases brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3M's sale of PFAScontaining products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. The plaintiffs in these two water utilities cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Centre, Alabama and Rome, Georgia. The Centre case has been set for trial in November 2023. The City of Rome case had been scheduled for trial in June 2023, as discussed in more detail above but, the case resolved by settlement between the parties shortly before trial. Another case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. That case continues, with class certification and other motions recently briefed.\n\nIn April 2023, another case that included similar allegations was filed by Shelby County, Alabama, and Talladega County, Alabama, against 3M and other defendants. Those cases have been removed to federal court, where they are proceeding through discovery.\n\n3 M , together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery, which has been extended by the court through November 2023.\n\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3 M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022, which was granted in part and denied in part in February 2023. The claims that will proceed against 3 M and other defendants, including negligence, wantonness, and public nuisance, are moving into discovery.\n\nIn California, 3M, Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities were named as defendants in an action brought in state court by the City of Corona and a local utility authority, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs' water sources and also referring to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of contamination. The court granted demurrers filed by Decra and the DuPont entities, while 3 M answered the complaint in February 2022. This case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL. In October 2022, a putative class action was filed against the Company and other parties on behalf of individuals who have been drinking water from the Temescal Subbasin, from which the City of Corona gets its water, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and medical monitoring.

        "answers": "Coosa River",
        "context": "In New York, 3 M is defending 40 individual cases filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and five additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. and DuPont. Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non-3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. Plaintiffs in both the federal and state individual cases assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. A mediation involving plaintiffs from 32 of the federal and state cases and all of the defendants was held in April 2023. 3M and certain of the other defendants have agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs involved in the mediation, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3M's share is not considered material. These cases will continue to move forward as to certain remaining defendants, and the other remaining cases continue. Additionally, 3 M is defending a case in New York state court filed by the Town of Petersburgh in September 2022. Plaintiff alleges that 3 M and several other manufacturers contributed to PFOA contamination in the town's public water supply. Oral argument on a motion to dismiss that was filed by 3 M and the other defendants is scheduled for July 2023. 3M is also defending 22 individual cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers, including 9 new complaints filed on behalf of additional water districts during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3 M , DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs' water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. 3 M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\n\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine. The action arose from Wolverine's allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverine's shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3M's product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. 3 M and Wolverine agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs, and 3M's share is not considered material; the court approved the class settlement in March 2023 and 3M's final payment related to the settlement was made in June 2023.\n\nIn Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending two state court cases brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3M's sale of PFAScontaining products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. The plaintiffs in these two water utilities cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Centre, Alabama and Rome, Georgia. The Centre case has been set for trial in November 2023. The City of Rome case had been scheduled for trial in June 2023, as discussed in more detail above but, the case resolved by settlement between the parties shortly before trial. Another case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. That case continues, with class certification and other motions recently briefed.\n\nIn April 2023, another case that included similar allegations was filed by Shelby County, Alabama, and Talladega County, Alabama, against 3M and other defendants. Those cases have been removed to federal court, where they are proceeding through discovery.\n\n3 M , together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery, which has been extended by the court through November 2023.\n\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3 M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022, which was granted in part and denied in part in February 2023. The claims that will proceed against 3 M and other defendants, including negligence, wantonness, and public nuisance, are moving into discovery.\n\nIn California, 3M, Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities were named as defendants in an action brought in state court by the City of Corona and a local utility authority, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs' water sources and also referring to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of contamination. The court granted demurrers filed by Decra and the DuPont entities, while 3 M answered the complaint in February 2022. This case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL. In October 2022, a putative class action was filed against the Company and other parties on behalf of individuals who have been drinking water from the Temescal Subbasin, from which the City of Corona gets its water, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and medical monitoring. This case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL.",

        "context": "As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker's compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the State's motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to $\\$ 5,000$ per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3 M 's respirators. In the first quarter of 2023 , a bench trial for the unfair trade practices claims was continued indefinitely. An expert witness retained by the State has recently estimated that 3 M sold over five million respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia as to key issues, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a factfinder may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.\n\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n\n\nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company's mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims (collectively, the \"Claims Data\"). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses this analysis to develop its estimate of probable liability.\n\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Company's accrual, including the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, and the average cost of defending and resolving claims and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other codefendants and insurers.\n\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in the first six months of 2023 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $\\$ 33$ million. In the first six months of 2023, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $\\$ 49$ million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $\\$ 588$ million. This accrual represents the Company's estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of (i) the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the fact that complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company's estimate of liabilities.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company's receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $\\$ 4$ million. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.",

        "answers": "185",
        "context": "If the court approves the PWS Settlement and all conditions in the PWS Settlement are met, 3 M will pay $\\$ 10.5$ billion to $\\$ 12.5$ billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $\\$ 10.3$ billion in the second quarter of 2023 . The charge reflects the present value (discounted at an estimated $5.2 \\%$ interest rate at time of proposed settlement) of the expected $\\$ 12.5$ billion nominal value of 3 M 's payments under the PWS Settlement. The PWS Settlement calls for 3M to make payments annually from 2024 through 2036. The actual amounts that 3 M will pay will be determined in part by which, if any, class members that do not have a positive test result for the presence of PFAS in their drinking water (as defined by the PWS Settlement) as of the date of the PWS Settlement receive such a test result by the end of 2025.\n\nThe PWS Settlement gives 3M the option to terminate the PWS Settlement if the numbers of eligible class members opting out of the Settlement exceed specified levels. The PWS Settlement provides that 3 M does not admit any liability or wrongdoing and does not waive any defenses. The Settlement remains subject to preliminary and final approval from the MDL court.\n\nThe previously disclosed case filed by the City of Stuart, Florida that was selected by the MDL court as the first bellwether trial was also settled as a part of the PWS Settlement.\n\nThe MDL court has also directed the parties to submit a proposal for an initial set of personal injury bellwether cases. The MDL court has indicated that the parties will be expected to begin discovery on a set of 28 cases to be selected as potential personal injury bellwether cases. In September 2022, the court issued an order denying defendants' MDL-wide summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense, which defense can be presented to a jury at future trials.\n\nOutside the MDL, trial was also scheduled to occur in June 2023 in a lawsuit brought by the City of Rome, Georgia, which asserted claims against 3 M and other defendants for compensatory damages, statutory damages for alleged violation of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief. The parties reached a settlement agreement to resolve the case and, under the terms of the PWS Settlement, associated estimated payments factor in amounts related to the City of Rome settlement. The PWS Settlement amounts discussed above therefore include the City of Rome settlement.\n\n\nOther AFFF Cases\n\n\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL, and one case was voluntarily dismissed. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are stayed by agreement of the parties.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company is aware of approximately 185 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. 3 M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, several cases are expected to remain pending in state courts.\n\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\n\nOther PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M's customers' improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3 M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc. (\"Wolverine\"), Georgia-Pacific LLC, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet manufacturers.\n\nThe cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will fall under the PWS Settlement if the water providers do not opt out of the PWS Settlement.",

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in \"Fulfillment\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nVendor Agreements\n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive funds for advertising services, cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, and volume rebates. We generally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and therefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Vendor rebates are typically dependent upon reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts.

Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing costs primarily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and television advertising. We pay commissions to participants in our Associates program when their customer referrals result in product sales and classify such costs as \"Marketing\" on our consolidated statements of operations. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\n\nAdvertising and other promotional costs are expensed as incurred and were $\\$ 3.8$ billion , $\\$ 5.0$ billion , and $\\$ 6.3$ billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 .\n\nTechnology and Content\n\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts.

While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as \"Technology and content.\" Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.\n\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.\n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts.

To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\n\nThe increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.\n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\n\nTechnology and Content\n\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.\n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure.\n\nFor 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized $\\$ 642$ million (including $\\$ 114$ million of stock-based compensation), $\\$ 511$ million (including $\\$ 94$ million of stock-based compensation), and $\\$ 395$ million (including $\\$ 84$ million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $\\$ 635$ million , $\\$ 634$ million , and $\\$ 545$ million for 2015,2016 , and 2017 .\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.",

Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\n\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Sales Tax or Other Tax Liabilities\n\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially. In the U.S., although Supreme Court decisions restrict states' rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, the Supreme Court has recently agreed to hear a case that could overturn prior precedent. We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system.\n\nWe are also subject to U.S. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies.

Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\n\nWe Could Be Subject to Additional Income Tax Liabilities\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.

We seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our retail websites and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. In addition, we provide services, such as fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \"Note 11\u2014Segment Information.\"\n\nPrior Period Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the expanded presentation of \"Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\" on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the allocation of stock-based compensation to \"Other operating expense, net\" in the segment results within \"Note 11 - Segment Information.\" These revised segment results reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations. In addition, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were reclassified from \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" to \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities (collectively, the \"Company\"). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (\"Whole Foods Market\") have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements, incentive discount offers, sales returns, vendor funding, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, income taxes, valuation and impairment of investments, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, collectability of receivables, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, depreciable lives of property and equipment, internal-use software and website development costs, acquisition purchase price allocations, investments in equity interests, and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\nEarnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.",

Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2017, of $\\$ 11.1$ billion , an assumed $5 \\%, 10 \\%$, and $20 \\%$ adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $\\$ 555$ million, $\\$ 1.1$ billion, and $\\$ 2.2$ billion. All investments are classified as \"available-for-sale.\" Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss,\" a separate component of stockholders' equity.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31,2017 , an assumed $5 \\%, 10 \\%$, and $20 \\%$ adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $\\$ 280$ million, $\\$ 600$ million, and $\\$ 1.3$ billion, recorded to \"Other income (expense), net.\"\n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Results of Operations-Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\" for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $\\$ 737$ million. We record our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $\\$ 415$ million of our investments as of December 31, 2017. We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.",

We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\n\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. In addition, for the matters disclosed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.\n\nSee also \"Note 10-Income Taxes.\"\n\n\nNote 8-STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nWe have authorized 500 million shares of $\\$ 0.01$ par value preferred stock.

These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.\n\nStock Repurchase Activity\n\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $\\$ 5.0$ billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. This stock repurchase authorization replaced the previous $\\$ 2.0$ billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2010. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2015,2016 , or 2017 .\n\nStock Award Plans\n\nEmployees vest in restricted stock unit awards and stock options over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years .",

        "context": "Fulfillment\n\n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as \"Technology and content.\" Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.\n\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.\n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\n\nMarketing\n\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, Associates program, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\n\nThe increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.\n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\n\nTechnology and Content\n\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS, as well as these and other efforts. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.\n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure.\n\nFor 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized $\\$ 642$ million (including $\\$ 114$ million of stock-based compensation), $\\$ 511$ million (including $\\$ 94$ million of stock-based compensation), and $\\$ 395$ million (including $\\$ 84$ million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $\\$ 635$ million , $\\$ 634$ million , and $\\$ 545$ million for 2015,2016 , and 2017 .\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.",

        "context": "Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.

These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance programs. To manage this increased risk, the Firm implemented additional controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations.\n\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm's control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.\n\nCybersecurity Risk\nThe Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber attacks due to potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm implemented additional precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity breaches will provide absolute security against cyber attacks.",

        "questions": "What factors are considered in the earnings-at-risk scenarios for JPMorgan Chase?",
        "answers": "These scenarios consider many different factors, including: - The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. - Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes.",
        "context": "Earnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm's reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (\"non-U.S. dollar\" currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\n- The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n- Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.\n- The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm's interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm's net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information).\nThe Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe change in the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm's baseline for higher rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's balance sheet.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Firm's sensitivity to the +100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a +100 basis points shift in long-term rates and the -100 basis points shift in rates are primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.\nThe Firm's non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021.\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm's earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n78",

        "context": "Lending-related commitments\nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.\n\nReceivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDerivative contracts\n\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchangetraded derivatives (\"ETD\"), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (\"OTC-cleared\") derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (\"CCP\"). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm's over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements - excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily - was approximately $87 \\%$ and $88 \\%$ at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$ 81.3$ billion and $\\$ 57.1$ billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was driven by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.\n\nThe benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor.

Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.\n\nReceivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDerivative contracts\n\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchangetraded derivatives (\"ETD\"), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (\"OTC-cleared\") derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (\"CCP\"). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.\n\nThe percentage of the Firm's over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements - excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily - was approximately $87 \\%$ and $88 \\%$ at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $\\$ 81.3$ billion and $\\$ 57.1$ billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase was driven by higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.\n\nThe benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements.",

        "answers": "An increase of approximately $250 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.",
        "context": "In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $\\$ 21$ billion, which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of $\\$ 1.2$ billion. As of December 31, 2018, amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled $\\$ 9.6$ billion, of which $\\$ 1.5$ billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $\\$ 5.4$ billion and $\\$ 1.5$ billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases, respectively.\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $\\$ 250$ million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Year Ended December 31, 2017 & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Previously Reported} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Adjustments} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{As Revised} \\\\\n  Operating activities & \\$ & 18,434 & \\$ & $(69)$ & \\$ & 18,365 \\\\\n  Investing activities & & $(27,819)$ & & 735 & & $(27,084)$ \\\\\n  Financing activities & & 9,860 & & 68 & & 9,928 \\\\\n  Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash & \\$ & 475 & \\$ & 734 & \\$ & 1,209 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie costs. The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs. Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $\\$ 1.0$ billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in \"Other Assets\" as of December 31, 2019.",

Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $\\$ 21$ billion, which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of $\\$ 1.2$ billion. As of December 31, 2018, amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled $\\$ 9.6$ billion, of which $\\$ 1.5$ billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $\\$ 5.4$ billion and $\\$ 1.5$ billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases, respectively.\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $\\$ 250$ million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Year Ended December 31, 2017 & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Previously Reported} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Adjustments} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{As Revised} \\\\\n  Operating activities & \\$ & 18,434 & \\$ & $(69)$ & \\$ & 18,365 \\\\\n  Investing activities & & $(27,819)$ & & 735 & & $(27,084)$ \\\\\n  Financing activities & & 9,860 & & 68 & & 9,928 \\\\\n  Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash & \\$ & 475 & \\$ & 734 & \\$ & 1,209 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie costs. The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs. Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $\\$ 1.0$ billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in \"Other Assets\" as of December 31, 2019.",

        "context": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\n\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\n\nWe Face Intense Competition\n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\n\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\n\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n- our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;",

        "context": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\n\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.\n\nWe Face Intense Competition\n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\n\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.\n\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease.

On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately $\u20ac 250$ million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission's decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.

These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2019.

We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n\nNote 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

        "questions": "What method is primarily used to account for inventories consisting of products available for sale?",
        "answers": "first-in, first-out method",
        "context": "Inventories\n\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.\n\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers' programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\n\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\n\nIncluded in \"Accounts receivable, net and other\" on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, customer receivables, net, were $\\$ 9.4$ billion and $\\$ 12.6$ billion, vendor receivables, net, were $\\$ 3.2$ billion and $\\$ 4.2$ billion, and seller receivables, net, were $\\$ 710$ million and $\\$ 863$ million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory.\n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred.

Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nLeases\n\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\n\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst \\& Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nLimitations on Controls\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.",

We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\n\nThe following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2019 (in millions, except percentages):\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2020} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2022} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2023} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{2024} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Thereafter} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Total} & \\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2019} \\\\\n  Money market funds & \\$ & 18,850 & \\$ & - & \\$ & - & \\$ & - & \\$ & - & \\$ & - & \\$ & 18,850 & \\$ & 18,850 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $1.09 \\%$ & & \u2014\\% & & \u2014\\% & & \u2014\\% & & -\\% & & $-\\%$ & & 1.09\\% & & \\\\\n  Corporate debt securities & & 7,629 & & 2,988 & & 1,052 & & 152 & & 8 & & - & & 11,829 & & 11,881 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $2.29 \\%$ & & $2.63 \\%$ & & $2.57 \\%$ & & $2.38 \\%$ & & $2.90 \\%$ & & $-\\%$ & & $2.41 \\%$ & & \\\\\n  U.S. government and agency securities & & 4,893 & & 1,634 & & 486 & & 43 & & 16 & & - & & 7,072 & & 7,080 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $1.64 \\%$ & & $2.09 \\%$ & & $2.01 \\%$ & & $2.29 \\%$ & & $2.03 \\%$ & & $-\\%$ & & $1.77 \\%$ & & \\\\\n  Asset-backed securities & & 1,492 & & 546 & & 180 & & 95 & & 38 & & - & & 2,351 & & 2,360 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $2.57 \\%$ & & $2.52 \\%$ & & $2.53 \\%$ & & $2.29 \\%$ & & $2.52 \\%$ & & $-\\%$ & & $2.54 \\%$ & & \\\\\n  Foreign government and agency securities & & 4,630 & & 168 & & 4 & & - & & 2 & & - & & 4,804 & & 4,794 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $1.90 \\%$ & & $2.57 \\%$ & & $2.08 \\%$ & & -\\% & & 2.30\\% & & $-\\%$ & & $1.92 \\%$ & & \\\\\n  Other fixed income securities & & 93 & & 94 & & 129 & & 75 & & - & & - & & 391 & & 394 \\\\\n  Weighted average interest rate & & $2.39 \\%$ & & $2.32 \\%$ & & $2.10 \\%$ & & $1.92 \\%$ & & -\\% & & - \\% & & $2.19 \\%$ & & \\\\\n  & $\\$$ & 37,587 & \\$ & 5,430 & \\$ & 1,851 & \\$ & 365 & \\$ & 64 & \\$ & $-$ & \\$ & 45,297 & & \\\\\n  Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & \\$ & 45,359 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}",

The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $\\$ 22$ million and $\\$ 23$ million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities.

There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.\n\nWhere no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022.

In accordance with the regulation, Tiet\u00ea will be compensated in the form of a concession extension period, initially determined to be 2.7 years, which will be amortized from the date of the agreement until the end of the new concession period. As of December 31, 2020, the compensation to be received from the concession extension was estimated to have a fair value of $\\$ 184$ million, based on a preliminary time-value equivalent calculation made by the CCEE, and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2021, the CCEE's final calculation of fair value was $\\$ 190$ million and the Company recognized an additional reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales of $\\$ 6$ million. In August 2021, ANEEL published Resolution 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originally granted to AES Brasil's hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032.

As of December 31, 2020, the compensation to be received from the concession extension was estimated to have a fair value of $\\$ 184$ million, based on a preliminary time-value equivalent calculation made by the CCEE, and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2021, the CCEE's final calculation of fair value was $\\$ 190$ million and the Company recognized an additional reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales of $\\$ 6$ million. In August 2021, ANEEL published Resolution 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originally granted to AES Brasil's hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032.

        "context": "Litigation - The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $\\$ 22$ million and $\\$ 23$ million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities. A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regulatory matters and commercial disputes in international jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.\n\nWhere no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022. The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged breaches of contract; alleged violation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $\\$ 51$ million and $\\$ 88$ million. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include the amounts accrued, as discussed above. These material contingencies do not include income tax-related contingencies which are considered part of our uncertain tax positions.

On September 30, 2022, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures approved a recommendation to the SWRCB to consider an extension of the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC, to December 31, 2026, in support of grid reliability. SWRCB released a draft OTC Policy amendment early in 2023 to be heard by the SWRCB on March 7, 2023. The final decision from SWRCB is expected during the second half of 2023.\n\nPower plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets.\n\nChallenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWater Discharges \u2014 In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"the agencies\") published a rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the \"Waters of the U.S.\" (WOTUS) rule. This rule, which initially became effective in August 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015 WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issued the final \"Navigable Waters Protection\" (NWP) rule which again revised the definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remanding the NWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies nationwide. As such, the agencies again interpreted waters of the U.S. consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime. On January 18, 2023, the Agencies published a final rule to define the scope of waters regulated under the CWA. The rule restores regulations defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates intended to be consistent with relevant Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on a wetlands case (Sackett v. EPA) on the limited question of: \"Whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are 'waters of the United States' under the Clean Water Act.\" The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy's \"significant nexus\" test from the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision; the plurality opinion in Rapanos required a water body to have a \"continuous surface connection\" with a water of the United States in order to be considered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA, the Court may finally provide clarity on which test from the 2006 Rapanos decision controls. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated NWP rule or any outcome of litigation may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization wastewater. However, it is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. The Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to determination of \"functional equivalent\" are ongoing in various jurisdictions. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation to \"functional equivalent\" may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nSelenium Rule - In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in fresh water. NPDES permits may be updated to include selenium water quality-based effluent limits based on a site-specific evaluation process, which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water body utilizing actual and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges.",

County of Maui case related to whether a CWA permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source, such as groundwater. The Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. A number of legal cases relevant to determination of \"functional equivalent\" are ongoing in various jurisdictions. It is too early to determine whether the Supreme Court decision or the result of litigation to \"functional equivalent\" may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nSelenium Rule - In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in fresh water.

        "context": "permit has been administratively extended. On September 30, 2022, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures approved a recommendation to the SWRCB to consider an extension of the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC, to December 31, 2026, in support of grid reliability. SWRCB released a draft OTC Policy amendment early in 2023 to be heard by the SWRCB on March 7, 2023. The final decision from SWRCB is expected during the second half of 2023.\n\nPower plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets.\n\nChallenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWater Discharges \u2014 In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"the agencies\") published a rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S., known as the \"Waters of the U.S.\" (WOTUS) rule. This rule, which initially became effective in August 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to CWA permitting. However, after repealing the 2015 WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019, the agencies, on April 21, 2020, issued the final \"Navigable Waters Protection\" (NWP) rule which again revised the definition of waters of the U.S. On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remanding the NWP Rule. This vacatur of the NWP Rule applies nationwide. As such, the agencies again interpreted waters of the U.S. consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime. On January 18, 2023, the Agencies published a final rule to define the scope of waters regulated under the CWA. The rule restores regulations defining WOTUS that were in place prior to 2015, with updates intended to be consistent with relevant Supreme Court decisions. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on a wetlands case (Sackett v. EPA) on the limited question of: \"Whether the Ninth Circuit set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are 'waters of the United States' under the Clean Water Act.\" The Ninth Circuit employed Justice Kennedy's \"significant nexus\" test from the 2006 Rapanos v. United States decision; the plurality opinion in Rapanos required a water body to have a \"continuous surface connection\" with a water of the United States in order to be considered a wetland covered by the CWA. In Sackett v. EPA, the Court may finally provide clarity on which test from the 2006 Rapanos decision controls. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated NWP rule or any outcome of litigation may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash, and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas desulfurization wastewater. AES Indiana Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas desulfurization wastewater. However, it is too early to determine whether any outcome of litigation or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v.

It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity's own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. & January 1, 2022 & The Company adopted this standard on a fully retrospective basis and its adoption resulted in a $\\$ 13$ million increase to Preferred Stock and a corresponding decrease to Additional paid-in capital. No impact to Earnings per Share amounts reported in 2021 or 2022. \\\\\n  2020-04, 2021-01, and 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting & The amendments in these updates provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference to LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued by reference rate reform, and clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. These amendments are effective for a limited period of time (March 12, 2020 - December 31, 2024). & Effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 & The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements. \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nASC 326 - Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses and its subsequent corresponding updates (\"ASC 326\"). The new standard updates the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities are required to use a new forward-looking \"expected loss\" model that generally results in the earlier recognition of an allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses as it was done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the income statement.\n\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326. Under this transition method, the Company applied the transition provisions starting at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 326 on our January 1, 2020 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows (in millions):\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n  Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Balance at December 31, 2019} & \\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{Adjustments Due to ASC 326} & \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Balance at January 1, 2020} \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{7}{|l|}{Assets} \\\\\n  Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $\\$ 20$ & \\$ & 1,479 & \\$ & - & \\$ & 1,479 \\\\\n  Other current assets & & 802 & & (2) & & 800 \\\\\n  Deferred income taxes & & 156 & & 9 & & 165 \\\\\n  Loan receivable, net of allowance of \\$32 & & 1,351 & & $(32)$ & & 1,319 \\\\\n  Other noncurrent assets ${ }^{(1)}$ & & 1,635 & & $(30)$ & & 1,605 \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{7}{|l|}{Liabilities and Equity} \\\\\n  Accumulated deficit & \\$ & (692) & \\$ & (39) & \\$ & (731) \\\\\n  Noncontrolling interests & & 2,233 & & (16) & & 2,217 \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\footnotetext{\n(1) Other noncurrent assets include Argentina financing receivables.\n}",

The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nTransactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or losses associated with noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously reported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the disposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance.\n\nFAIR VALUE - Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items Short-term investments and Other noncurrent assets; derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets; and, derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other noncurrent liabilities. The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or of an asset acquisition by a variable interest entity, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group, equity method investments, or goodwill.\n\nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.\n\nIn determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\n- Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or\n- Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.\n\nAny transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not restricted as to withdrawal or usage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\n\nRESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES - Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via contract, are considered restricted cash.",

        "questions": "What is the material weakness reported by Fluence as of December 31, 2022?",
        "answers": "A material weakness in its internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not yet been remediated.",
        "context": "Further, we have a significant equity method investment in Fluence. As a publicly listed company, Fluence is governed by its own Board of Directors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the Fluence shareholders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the Fluence Board of Directors, the interests of the Fluence shareholders, as represented by the Fluence Board of Directors, may not align with our interests or the interests of our securityholders. As of December 31, 2022, Fluence continues to report that a material weakness in its internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not yet been remediated. Such material weakness can impact the reliability of the Fluence financial information that we may include as part of our financial information.\n\nIn addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position.\n\n\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our foreign operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWe may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.\nWe routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk,\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.\n\nOur utilities businesses may experience slower growth in customers or in customer usage.\n\nCustomer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by external factors, including mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic",

        "context": "Further, we have a significant equity method investment in Fluence. As a publicly listed company, Fluence is governed by its own Board of Directors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the Fluence shareholders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the Fluence Board of Directors, the interests of the Fluence shareholders, as represented by the Fluence Board of Directors, may not align with our interests or the interests of our securityholders. As of December 31, 2022, Fluence continues to report that a material weakness in its internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not yet been remediated. Such material weakness can impact the reliability of the Fluence financial information that we may include as part of our financial information.\n\nIn addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position.\n\n\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our foreign operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWe may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.\nWe routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk,\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.\n\nOur utilities businesses may experience slower growth in customers or in customer usage.\n\nCustomer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by external factors, including mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic",

        "context": "increase at AES Brasil is primarily due to the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations as a result of the Cubico II acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at AES Clean Energy and Chile by $\\$ 93$ million and $\\$ 36$ million, respectively. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations as a result of the New York Wind acquisition. The increase in Chile is primarily due to shortened useful lives of the Ventanas and Angamos coal plants, additional liabilities incurred due to the development of the Andes Solar 2b plant, and an upward revision of estimated cash flows at the Los Cururos plant.\n\n\n5. FAIR VALUE\n\n\nThe fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. Because these amounts are estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nValuation Techniques - The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value.\n\nInvestments - The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets.\n\nDerivatives - Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.\n\nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.\n\nTo determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument.

In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value.\n\nInvestments - The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets.\n\nDerivatives - Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.\n\nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.\n\nTo determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument.

        "context": "Goodwill Impairment Test for AES Andes and AES EI Salvador Reporting Units\n\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nHow We\n\nAddressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company's goodwill balance was $\\$ 362$ million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss is measured at the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for the AES Andes and AES EI Salvador reporting units and utilized the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of these reporting units. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the estimated fair value was less than the carrying amount for both of these reporting units and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $\\$ 777$ million during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAuditing the Company's annual goodwill impairment tests for the AES Andes and AES EI Salvador reporting units required judgment to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic and industry conditions and involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of these reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of the reporting units involve the use of significant unobservable inputs and are sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, such as the interest rates and country risk premiums, which are inputs used to determine the discount rates.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review and testing process for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation models, the significant assumptions described above, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.\n\nTo test the estimated fair value for the AES Andes and AES EI Salvador reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to develop the estimated fair values, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the discount rates used in the fair value estimate.\n\nLong-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $\\$ 23,039$ million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company's useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $\\$ 661$ million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n\nDescription of the Matter",

We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the discount rates used in the fair value estimate.\n\nLong-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $\\$ 23,039$ million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company's useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $\\$ 661$ million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n\nDescription of the Matter",
