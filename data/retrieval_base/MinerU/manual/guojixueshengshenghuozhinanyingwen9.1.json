        "text": "# \nAccording to Chinese law, it is not possible to apply for a  visa or change visas by entering Mainland China using a  visa-free entry.  Do not use a visa-free entry to enter into  China.   \n# \nChina,  please carefully research visa types, and read the  description below: \na. X1 Visa: The X1 visa generally permits only one entry, and  students must register at the university within 30 days  after entry in order to apply for the required residence  permit, otherwise it constitutes illegal residence. Since  the university does not accept students registering in  advance of the scheduled date, and it usually takes  3-5 working days to prepare the residence permit  application, it is suggested that international students  holding an X1 visa should have at least one week  remaining on their visa before its expiry date at the time  of registration at the university.  \nb. X2 Visa: The number of entries and the duration of  stay permitted per entry are both indicated on the X2  visa. Once international students on an X2 visa enter  the country, they should keep in mind the permitted  duration of their stay on their visa and must register at  the university within the time limit specified. \n2. Regarding visa collection:  When picking up one’s  passport containing the visa for China, please ensure  that the Embassy or Consulate returns the original  copy of the  Admission Notice  and the  Visa Application for  Study in China  (JW202/201 Form). These are important  and required documents for international students  for their study, residence permit application and other  procedures whilst in China.\n\n \n# \n1. The nationality of the passport used by the international  student when registering at the university should be  consistent with the nationality listed when applying to  study at the university, otherwise they will not be able to  register.\n\n \n2. For international students who have both foreign  nationality and a residence identity from Hong Kong,  Macao or China Taiwan, if they applied to the university  under their foreign nationality they must not register at  the university using travel documents for Hong Kong,  Macao and China Taiwan (such as the Mainland Travel  Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents and the  Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents). \n\\* Please note that entry into Mainland China from Hong  Kong S.A.R., Macao S.A.R., or China Taiwan is considered  as one entry. \n\n# \nThe university arranges specific registration dates for all  international students to register at the university. Advance  registration is not available. International students whose  visa, stay permit or residence permit has expired or will  expire in too short a time to go through the registration  formalities will not be permitted to register at the  university. Therefore, travel planning is essential. Please  do not enter into China too early in advance before the  designated university registration period to avoid the risk  \nof the entry visa expiring before registration, which will  lead to an inability to register at the university or other  difficulties. \nIn addition, after registration, international students  applying for a residence permit will be without their  passport for approximately 3-4 weeks while it is being  processed. International students holding an X2 visa,  who after registration need to apply for an extension or  increase of the number of entries on their visa, will be  without their passport for approximately 3-4 weeks."

According to  Chinese government regulations, after the university  registration period has concluded, the university will report  all unregistered international students to the Division of  Exit and Entry Administration of the Beijing Public Security  Bureau.  \nIf a student holds a visa to study in China but does not  register at the university they have been admitted to, the  visa may be cancelled and the individual will be penalized  for making an illegal stay. \n# \nIt is illegal to stay in China after a visa, stay permit or  residence permit has expired. Those committing such an  offense will be subject to a fine of 500 RMB per day and  will face detainment or deportation. \n# \nAll international students must submit the completed  Foreigner Physical Examination Form . Below are the  two options for how the physical examination can be  completed.  \n# \nThe  Foreigner Physical Examination Form  is included in the  admission package that will be sent to students in the  mail prior to arrival at the university. The student can take  the form to a hospital or clinic in their home country. The  form should be written, signed and stamped by the doctor  conducting the examination. The original form must then  be brought to China (including the original blood test  reports) and presented at the Beijing International Travel  Healthcare Center - Haidian branch for authentication. The  student will then receive a Physical Examination Report  after authentication is approved. If the health documents  provided do not meet the Beijing International Travel  Healthcare Center’s standards, the student must redo  the health examination at the Beijing International Travel  Healthcare Center. \n# \nAfter arriving in China, students can undergo the physical  examination at the Beijing International Travel Healthcare  Center - Haidian branch to obtain the Physical Examination  Report. More information can be found by referring to the  Physical Examination Authentication  section, on page 12 of  this Guide. \n# \n# \nIn China, only banks are authorized to provide legal  exchange services of foreign currencies. Before trying  to exchange foreign currency, check with bank service  personnel whether the bank is able to provide the  exchange service for the required foreign currency.  Sometimes it is necessary to make an appointment in  advance (usually one working day in advance). Non- Chinese citizens can exchange no more than 500 US dollars  of foreign currency per day (for specific information, please  consult the bank). Therefore, planning ahead is essential if  a large amount of foreign currency is to be exchanged. \nA valid passport is required to be presented at the bank  when exchanging foreign currency. Be mindful that the  exchange rate of different banks is different, and that the  exchange rate fluctuates in real time throughout the day. \n# \nAs banks require several days to complete a wire transfer, it is  recommended that students bring a sufficient amount of cash  with them to China to pay for the first month's living expenses. \n# \nBanks impose a daily withdrawal limit on credit and debit  cards. Students should confirm the daily limit of their personal  credit card/debit card within China with their bank before  departure."

The university does not recommend  students to purchase electric vehicles (including scooters).\n\n    The primary mode of on-campus transportation is by bicycle  (either personal bicycles or shared bikes). Bicycles should be  locked after use. When walking or cycling on campus, please  use the pavement or lanes for non-motorized vehicles. Do  not ride in a dangerous manner, such as riding the wrong  way down a roadway, speeding, or turning without signaling.\n\n \n# \n   Do not leave large amounts of cash; student IC card;  keys  or other important and valuable objects out in one’s room.  Either keep them safely locked away or on one’s person. \n\n    Obey dormitory regulations. When leaving the student  dormitory room or resting inside the dormitory, lock the  windows and door and do not let others stay in the room.  When entering a dormitory building, make sure that others  do not sneak in behind. Take an active role to prevent the  subleasing of dormitory rooms by reporting such situations  to the building staff or security staff.\n\n    Be careful when using electricity inside the dormitory.

If necessary, see a doctor for diagnosis and  treatment.\n\n \n# \n   When choosing a specific online shopping website,  first compare information such as volume of trade and  customer reviews.

Keep hold of proof of transactions,  such as records of communication, delivery numbers  and evidence of payments.\n\n    After receiving the purchased item, open and inspect the  package immediately. If the product is not the same as  was advertised or there is a problem with its quality, the  recipient has the right to reject the delivery.

        "text": "# \n# \nThe four seasons in Beijing are generally as follows.  \nSpring (March-May):  Weather is pleasant, temperatures  between 0°C and 26°C (32°F and 79°F) \nSummer (June-August): Hot and humid, temperatures  between 18°C and 35°C (66°F and 95°F)  \nAutumn (September-November): Cool with occasional  rain, temperatures between 0°C and 26°C (32°F and 79°F) Winter (December-February): Cold, dry and windy,  temperatures between -8°C and 5°C (16°F and 41°F) \nIn the north of China, most public buildings will be heated  between mid-November and mid-March. Buildings will  often open their windows during winter to maintain a  healthy level of air circulation. \n\n# \n# \nTaxis are commonly seen in China. Licensed taxis are  normally of the same design and should have the taxi  company logo displayed. Different cities have different  starting prices, but all are relatively affordable. Be careful  not to ride in unlicensed taxis. Check the taxi company,  driver and vehicle information (usually posted above the  \nfront passenger seat) and check whether there is a taxi  meter fitted and in operation (in Chinese:  打表计费) . \n# \nThe standard taxi fare is 2.30 RMB per kilometer. The  flag-down starting rate is 13 RMB (within the first 3  kilometers). The taxi fare fee may be a slightly higher rate  when in traffic jams and during evenings. \n# \nWhen taking a taxi, first check the car license plate.  Licensed taxis in Beijing should all have a car license plate  beginning with the letter B. Always ask for the receipt  when getting out of the taxi. \n\n# \nThe Beijing Subway and Light Rail Network (apart from the  airport express train) is a highly connected transportation  network. Prices depend on the distance travelled and  range from 3 to 7 RMB per journey. Tickets can be  purchased at the ticket window or by using the automatic  machines found at all subway stations. A rechargeable  Beijing transportation card can also be purchased, which  is used by most people who frequently travel via public"

        "text": "transportation. The transportation card must be  scanned upon both entry and exit of the subway. For  more information, visit: https://www.bjsubway.com/ en/. The nearest subway stations to Tsinghua University  are Qing hua dong lux i kou  ( 清华东路西口)  on line 15,  Wudaokou  ( 五道口)  on line 13, and Yuanmingyuan  ( 圆 明园) on line 4.\n\n# \nThe bus network in Beijing is a very affordable method of  transportation, with fees starting from 1 RMB using the  Beijing transportation card (the same one used for the  subway system), or from 2 RMB if paying in cash. The west,  south and north-east gates of Tsinghua all have bus stops  close-by. The nearest bus stop to the student dormitories  is the stop located by the north-east gate, where bus  number 549 travels to the nearby areas of Wudaokou and  Zhongguancun. For more information, visit: http://www. bjbus.com. \n# \nThe Wudaokou area is a student-hub, as it is located near  several universities, including Tsinghua. The busiest and  most bustling part of Wudaokou is centered on either side  of the Wudaokou subway station. Traffic jams are common,  especially during peak hour and thus attention should be  paid to personal safety.  \nThe Wudaokou area has an international atmosphere and  is filled with shops, restaurants, coffee shops and bars.  The main department store in Wudaokou, known as the U  Center, is home to clothing and lifestyle stores, a pharmacy  and the BHG supermarket on the basement floor housing  many international products. Nearby, there is also D-Mart -  a smaller international supermarket, and Lotus supermarket  - a large local supermarket chain.  \nNearby the Wudaokou subway station are bus stops that  can take you back to the north-east gate of Tsinghua  University (bus number 549) and several buses going in the  direction of nearby Peking University and Zhongguancun,  Beijing’s technology hub.  \nDue to its close proximity to Tsinghua University, many  students living off campus choose to live in apartment  blocks located in Wudaokou. Apart from Wudaokou, there is  also a nearby area called Liudaokou  ( 六道口) , where many  \nstudents also choose to live. It has its own subway station  of the same name on line 15, the Golden Towers shopping  market, and a large variety of Chinese restaurants. \n# \n# \nBeijing has a rich cultural history, the reason for which  many visitors come to the city. Famous sights in Beijing  include Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the National  Museum and the Museum of Science and Technology. There  is also the Bird’s Nest and Water Cube, where the 2008  Beijing Olympics were held, and one of the great wonders of  the world – the Great Wall. Furthermore, Peking University  and Tsinghua University - both with more than 100 years of  history - are also famous Beijing attractions. \n\\*   Note: Services, souvenirs, and food at tourist sites will  be more expensive than in other locations. Only buy  items after asking about the price. \n# \nFor booking plane tickets, train tickets and hotels, the Ctrip  website and app is widely used in China. Train tickets booked  online may be picked up at the on-campus China Post office at  the Zhaolanyuan area by taking one’s passport and showing  the ticket booking number, or they can be collected directly  from the tickets office counter at the train station. Please note: the first time train tickets are booked online  requires the individual to collect their ticket from the train  station. After this, they will be able to directly pick up train  tickets from subsidiary ticket providers, such as the China  Post office at Zhaolanyuan. \n# \nBelow are a few commonly used English language websites  that may help foreigners greater adapt to life in Beijing. \n•  The Beijinger . This community website created by foreign  expatriates provides information about life in Beijing. The  website features a blog and community forum to help  foreigners settle into Beijing life.  Website: www.thebeijinger.com \n•  Timeout Beijing . This website focuses on providing  lifestyle information to those that live in Beijing. Its content  covers popular products, fine dining, art and culture and  many other aspects of Beijing city life. Website: www.timeoutbeijing.com"
