Follow and retain all information included  with your computer. The information in this document does not alter the terms of your purchase agreement  or the Lenovo Limited Warranty. For more information, see \"Warranty Information\" in the  Safety and Warranty  Guide  that comes with your computer. \nCustomer safety is important. Our products are developed to be safe and effective. However, personal  computers are electronic devices. Power adapters and other features can create potential safety risks that  can result in physical injury or property damage, especially if misused. To reduce these risks, follow the  instructions included with your product, observe all warnings on the product and in the operating  instructions, and review the information included in this document carefully. By carefully following the  information contained in this document and provided with your product, you can help protect yourself from  hazards and create a safer computer work environment. \nNote:  This information includes references to power adapters and batteries. In addition to notebook  computers, some products (such as speakers and monitors) ship with external power adapters. If you have  such a product, this information applies to your product. In addition, computer products contain a coin-sized  internal battery that provides power to the system clock even when the computer is unplugged, so the  battery safety information applies to all computer products. \n# \nEnsure that you follow the important tips given here to get the most use and enjoyment out of your computer.  Failure to do so might lead to discomfort or injury, or cause the computer to fail. \n# \n\nWhen your computer is turned on or the battery is charging, the base, the palm  rest, and some other parts may become hot. The temperature they reach  depends on the amount of system activity and the level of charge in the  battery. Extended contact with your body, even through clothing, could cause  discomfort or even a skin burn. \n\n • Avoid keeping your hands, your lap, or any other part of your body in  contact with a hot section of the computer for any extended time.\n\n • Periodically take hands from using the keyboard by lifting your hands from  the palm rest."

Some product damage is serious enough  that the product should not be used again until it has been inspected and, if necessary, repaired by an  authorized servicer. \nAs with any electronic device, pay close attention to the product when it is turned on. On very rare  occasions, you might notice an odor or see a puff of smoke or sparks vent from your product. Or you  might hear sounds like popping, cracking or hissing. These conditions might merely mean that an  internal electronic component has failed in a safe and controlled manner. Or, they might indicate a  potential safety issue. However, do not take risks or attempt to diagnose the situation yourself.  Contact the Customer Support Center for further guidance. For a list of Service and Support phone  numbers, see the following Web site:  \n# \nFrequently inspect your computer and its components for damage or wear or signs of danger. If you  have any question about the condition of a component, do not use the product. Contact the Customer  Support Center or the product manufacturer for instructions on how to inspect the product and have it  repaired, if necessary. \nIn the unlikely event that you notice any of the following conditions, or if you have any safety concerns  with your product, stop using the product and unplug it from the power source and  telecommunication lines until you can speak to the Customer Support Center for further guidance."

        "text": "# \nUse only the power adapters supplied by the product manufacturer. \nNever wrap a power adapter cable around a power adapter or other object. Doing so can stress the  cord in ways that can cause the power adapter cable to fray, crack, or crimp. This can present a  safety hazard. \nAlways route the power adapter cable so that they will not be walked on, tripped over, or pinched by  objects. \nProtect power adapters from liquids. For instance, do not leave your power adapter near sinks,  tubs, toilets, or on floors that are cleaned with liquid cleansers. Liquids can cause a short circuit,  particularly if the power adapter has been stressed by misuse. Liquids also can cause gradual  corrosion of the connector terminals on a power adapter, which can eventually result in  overheating. \nEnsure that all power adapter connectors are securely and completely plugged into receptacles. \nDo not use any power adapter that shows corrosion at the ac input pins or shows signs of  overheating (such as deformed plastic) at the ac input pins or anywhere on the power adapter. \nTo prevent possible overheating, do not cover the power adapter with clothing or other objects  when the power adapter is plugged into an electrical outlet. \n# \nEnsure that extension cords, surge protectors, uninterruptible power supplies, and power strips that you use  are rated to handle the electrical requirements of the product. Never overload these devices. If power strips  are used, the load should not exceed the power strip input rating. Consult an electrician for more information  if you have questions about power loads, power requirements, and input ratings."

If the plug is damaged, contact the manufacturer to obtain a  replacement. \nDo not share an electrical outlet with other home or commercial appliances that draw large  amounts of electricity; otherwise, unstable voltage might damage your computer, data, or attached  devices. \nSome products are equipped with a three-pronged plug. This plug fits only into a grounded  electrical outlet. This is a safety feature. Do not defeat this safety feature by trying to insert it into a  non-grounded outlet. If you cannot insert the plug into the outlet, contact an electrician for an  approved outlet adapter or to replace the outlet with one that enables this safety feature. Never  overload an electrical outlet. The overall system load should not exceed 80 percent of the branch  circuit rating. Consult an electrician for more information if you have questions about power loads  and branch circuit ratings. \nBe sure that the power outlet you are using is properly wired, easily accessible, and located close to  the equipment.

See “Setting the security chip” on page 55.\n\n • If a Disk Encryption storage drive is installed in your computer, ensure to protect the contents of your  computer from unauthorized access by use of drive encryption software, such as Microsoft Windows  BitLocker ®  Drive Encryption.\n\n • Before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer, delete the data stored on it. For more  information, see “Deleting data from your storage drive” on page 58. \n# \nTo help protect your computer against unauthorized access, use the drive encryption software, such as  Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption. \nWindows BitLocker Drive Encryption (referred to as BitLocker) is an integral security feature of some editions  of the Windows operating system. It can help you protect the operating system and data stored on your  computer, even if your computer is lost or stolen. BitLocker can encrypt all user and system files, including  the swap and hibernation files. \nBitLocker uses the TPM to provide enhanced protection for your data and to ensure early boot component  integrity. A compatible TPM is defined as a V2.0 TPM. \nTo check the BitLocker status, go to Control Panel, view Control Panel by Category, and click  System and  Security  $\\rightarrow$    BitLocker Drive Encryption . \nFor more information, see the help system of the Windows operating system, or search for “Microsoft  Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Step-by-Step Guide” on the Microsoft Web site. \n# \nSome models contain the Disk Encryption hard disk drive, Encryption solid-state drive, or Encryption hybrid  drive. This encryption technology helps to protect your computer against security attacks on media, NAND  flash, or device controllers by use of a hardware encryption chip. For the efficient use of the encryption  feature, set a hard disk password for the internal storage drive. \n# \nStrict security requirements are imposed on network client computers that transfer confidential information  electronically. Depending on the options you ordered, your computer might have an embedded security chip \n\n (a cryptographic microprocessor). With the security chip, you can do the following: \n\n \n• Protect your data and system\n\n • Strengthen access controls\n\n • Secure communications 1. Restart the computer.

Otherwise, the  Clear Security Chip  option is not displayed. \n# \nDepending on the model, your computer might have a fingerprint reader. Fingerprint authentication can  replace your passwords, such as the Windows password, power-on password, and hard disk password. In  this way, you can log in to your computer simply and securely. \n# \nTo enable fingerprint authentication, enroll your fingerprints first. During the enrollment, the fingerprints are  associated with the Windows password automatically.

Write down your passwords, and keep them in a safe place. If you forget your power-on password, you must  take your computer to a Lenovo-authorized servicer or a marketing representative to have the password  canceled. If you forget your hard disk password, Lenovo cannot reset your password or recover data from  the storage drive.

Handing your computer over to someone  else without deleting the installed software, such as operating systems and programs, might even violate the  license agreements. Be sure to delete data stored on the storage drive before you dispose of, sell, or hand  over your computer. \nYou can use the following methods to delete data from the storage drive: \n\n \n• Move the data to the Recycle Bin, and then empty the Recycle Bin.\n\n • Format your storage drive, using the software to initialize it.\n\n • Use the recovery program provided by Lenovo to bring the storage drive back to the factory default  settings. \nThese operations, however, only change the file location of the data; they do not delete the data itself. The  data is still there, even though it seems to be lost. Thus, it is sometimes possible to read the data by use of  special software for data recovery. There is a risk that people of bad faith might read and misuse the critical  data on storage drives for unexpected purposes. \nTo prevent leakage of data, it is important that you delete all the data from the hard disk drive when you  dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. You can destroy the data physically by smashing the hard disk  drive with a hammer, or magnetically by means of strong magnetic power, thus making the data unreadable.  But it is recommended that you use the software (payware) or service (pay service) developed for that  purpose. The process might take several hours. \nFor disposing of data on the solid-state drive, Lenovo provides the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the  Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool. \nSome computers might support a Disk Encryption hard disk drive or Encryption solid-state drive and have  such a drive installed. You can logically dispose of all the data on the drive in a short time by erasing the  cryptographic key. The data encrypted with the old key is not physically erased but remains on the drive;  however, it cannot be decrypted without the old key. This feature is also available with the Drive Erase Utility  for Resetting the Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool. \n# \nIf your system is preinstalled with a firewall program, it protects against computer Internet security threats,  unauthorized access, intrusions, and Internet attacks.

You also might want to look for program duplication or  overlapping versions.\n\n • Clean out your Inbox, Sent, and Trash folders from your e-mail client program.\n\n • Back up your data at least once a week. If critical data is present, it is a good idea to back up the data  daily. Lenovo has many backup options available for your computer. \n\n • Schedule system restore operations to take a system snapshot periodically. For information about system  restore, see Chapter 8 “Recovery information” on page 97.\n\n • Go to  https://support.lenovo.com  to download and install updates for the device drivers and UEFI BIOS  when needed.\n\n • Keep up to date for device drivers on other non-Lenovo hardware. Before updating device drivers, read  the device driver information release notes for compatibility or known issues.\n\n • Keep a log book. Entries might include major hardware or software changes, driver updates, minor issues  you have experienced, and how you resolved the minor issues.\n\n • If you ever need to run a recovery on your computer to return the preinstalled contents onto the machine,  the following tips might help along the way:  1. Remove all external devices such as the printer and keyboard. 2. Ensure that your battery is charged and your computer has the ac power connected. 3. Access ThinkPad Setup and load the default settings. 4. Restart the computer and start the recovery operation. 5. If your computer uses discs as the recovery media, do not remove the disc from the drive until  prompted to do so. \n# \nMany computer problems can be solved without outside assistance. If you experience a problem with your  computer, the first place to start is the troubleshooting information in your computer documentation. If you  suspect a software problem, see the documentation, including readme files and help information systems,  that come with the operating system or program. ThinkPad notebook computers come with a set of  diagnostic programs that you can use to help you identify hardware problems. \nNote:  If you are unable to isolate and repair the problem yourself after running Lenovo Vantage, save and  print the log files created by the program. You need the log files when you speak to a Lenovo technical  support representative. \nLenovo Vantage supports the hardware scan function. It combines diagnostic tests, system information  collection, security status, and support information, along with hints and tips for optimal system  performance.

When the computer is off, reattach the removable battery and restart  the computer. If the computer does not start with the removable battery reattached, remove the  removable battery and again start with step 2. If the computer starts with ac power but does not start  when the removable battery is attached, call the Customer Support Center for support. \n3. While the computer is off, remove all sources of power (removable battery and the ac power adapter).  Remove all external devices that are attached to your computer (keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, and  so on). Repeat step 2.

To  help in this endeavor, Lenovo has preset the following power-management features to take effect when the  computer has been inactive for a specified length of time: \nPower plan:  Default (when plugged into ac power) \n\n \n• Turn off the display: After 10 minutes\n\n • Put the computer to sleep: After 30 minutes \nTo awaken the computer from sleep mode, press the Fn key on your keyboard. For more information about  these settings, see the Windows help information on the computer. \nThe Wake on LAN function is enabled when your Lenovo computer is shipped from the factory, and the  setting remains valid even when the computer is in sleep mode. If you do not need to have Wake on LAN  enabled while the computer is in sleep mode, you can reduce the power consumption and prolong the time  in sleep mode, by disabling the setting of Wake on LAN for sleep mode. \nTo disable the setting of Wake on LAN for sleep mode, do the following: \n\n \n1. Go to Control Panel and click  Hardware and Sound  $\\rightarrow$    Device Manager .\n\n 2. In the Device Manager window, expand  Network adapters .\n\n 3.
