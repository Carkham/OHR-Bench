        "text": "# \nNews \n# \n Once you’re satisfied that the criteria you’ve chosen in Search for Students will result in the list of names you’re looking for, click  Submit Order . You’ll be asked to provide additional details about your order by choosing several options. The first two, order type and start date, are worth careful consideration. \n\n# \nFor a one-time delivery of names, choose a single order. To receive several batches of names matching the same criteria, choose a standing order. \n# \nImprovements Student Search Service® Changes \nEnrollment Planning Service™ Changes \nDescriptor PLUS Changes \nManage Your Searches, Orders & Files \n\nPSAT/NMSQT Names \nTop Tips \nGlossary \nBeyond the Basics \nAbout the Data \nFAQs \nAccount Maintenance \nLicensing \nTraining \nImportant Documents \nContact Us \nThe single order is the simplest option. If you choose an immediate start date, you’ll be provided with an actual count of students who meet your criteria. This count shows the correct number after the search results have been deduplicated against your processed orders. However, the count does not include deduplication against prior orders that have been built or submitted, but not processed. \nWith a single order, you’re likely to miss students who meet your criteria but test later than your start date. You can view an estimated count of those students by changing your start date or changing your order type to a standing order. \n# \nWith a standing order, the system does the work for you. You’ll receive an initial list of student names plus new names meeting the same criteria throughout the time period you specify. You set the start date, the maximum number of names, the end date and the frequency with which you’d like to receive additional names. \nIf you choose an immediate start date, you’ll see two counts: an actual count of student names available right away (deduplicated against prior, processed orders) and an estimate of names available in the future. \nYou won’t know with certainty the total number of student names you’ll receive. And once your order has been processed, it will continue to run automatically — you won’t be able to adjust your criteria. \n# \nWhether you choose a single order or a standing order, you have three options for starting your order. \n# \nIf, judging by the name count, College Board Search already has the student names you need, choose an immediate start date and submit your order. \n# \nChoosing an immediate start date but waiting to submit your order can help you manage your time and your resources. Create the order when you have the time to strategize and to craft an effective search, but wait to submit it if the name count is low or if you expect new names meeting your criteria to be loaded in the future. \nWhen you’re ready to submit your order, you can check the final deduplicated name count and adjust criteria as needed. \n# \nTo submit the order now but delay processing, choose a custom date or a date when new data becomes available. For instance, you might want to place an SAT order in October but delay it until the December SAT data is loaded in January. Your order will be among the first processed when new data is loaded. \nIf you choose a future start date, you’ll see two counts: the actual number of names available immediately and an estimate of the total volume. This estimate is likely to be high since it won’t be deduplicated. Deduplication is impossible because student names for future assessments won't have been loaded yet. You won’t be able to adjust your criteria after you’ve placed the order. \n#"

        "text": "# \nNews \n# \nSearching PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10 takers is a good way to get the names and contact information of sophomores and juniors. To create an effective search, take some time to strategize first. \n# \nConsider these questions: What goal does this search serve?  Which students do I want to communicate with? What message do I want to send? \nImprovements Student Search Service® Changes \nThe answers will guide you as you select criteria that will include the students you aspire to enroll and eliminate the students unlikely to enroll. For instance, if your goal is to increase diversity, the ethnicity criterion in demographics will be a strategy driver. If your goal is to increase applications from female students of color interested in engineering, the gender criterion in demographics and the intended majors criterion will be additional strategy drivers. \nNote that many data fields are available in revised Student Search Service® data layout.

While you can send the same message to sophomores and juniors, consider their different perspectives on the college selection process — and the different messages that are likely to resonate with each grade level.  \nOnce you decide which class or classes to recruit, build the order in a way that lets you communicate the right message to the right group of students. \n# \nIf you don’t choose otherwise, your search results will be deduplicated. In other words, you can be certain your order will not include student names included in previously processed orders. If you license names of both sophomore and junior PSAT/NMSQT takers, you will not receive duplicate records for students who tested as sophomores and again as juniors. However, deduplication is not always the best choice. \nYou might wish to change the  New prospects  setting to  Include all students  if your goal is to reach out to all likely National Merit scholars. Students qualify for this scholarship by testing in their junior year, so a student who scores well as a junior, and whose name you may have already received as part of a sophomore search the year before, would not be part of a deduplicated search. \nAnother instance when deduplication might be inappropriate is when you want to send a specific message to a particular group. For example, if you want your coach to reach out to women lacrosse players, deduplicating the order would yield only those students who have never received any communication from your institution. \n# \nUse the College Board Exams section to limit your results to all or some PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10 takers within the cohorts you selected. Consider limiting your search to students likely to succeed at your institution by choosing specific score bands. Get more information on  searching by exam criteria . \n# \nAs you make other criteria selections to focus your search on the students most likely to apply to your institution and meet your enrollment goals, make sure you don’t narrow it so drastically that you miss out on students who might be a good fit. Remember that many data points are collected from SAT takers only and are not available for PSAT/NMSQT and PSAT 10 takers. Choosing these will limit your results to students who have also taken the SAT. \nHere are some tips: \nWatch the student name count in the upper-right corner of your screen to spot any significant drops. Look out for warnings about SAT-only criteria. To see which data is collected from which test-takers, view the  Student-Data-By-Exam table . \n# \nOnce you’ve built your search, click  View Dashboard  to evaluate it and ensure that it meets your needs.

What steps can you take to increase the effectiveness of the student lists you license? \nEnrollment officers tell us that their search efforts are more successful when they have a clear understanding of several key factors: The students they want to recruit Effective marketing strategies to reach these students The strengths and weaknesses of their competitors How competitors are reaching prospective students \nSuccessful users also set clear goals and monitor responses to know how effective their campaigns are and what, if anything, they should change.  \n# \nSearch for Students can help you meet many goals, including these: Increase the visibility of your institution by sending letters, brochures or other materials Reach a particular group with email and follow up with hard copy Augment the general inquiry pool Increase the enrollment of honors and AP students Strengthen majors that have low enrollment Increase student body diversity — racially, geographically or by gender Promote new programs Test new markets Invite students to campus events for specific events that will interest them \n# \nA growing number of colleges are designing search strategies to target students for particular departments or programs. Examples include: \nIdentifying high-achieving students for honors programs using College Board exam and high school academic criteria Deciding which prospects to contact about your representative’s visits to their schools and which to invite to your open houses using geography criteria Identifying prospects who might be interested in financial aid information using the financial aid plans criterion Finding prospects who will want to learn more about under-enrolled academic programs using the intended majors criterion Finding potential commuters using the geography and college living plans criteria Visit  Power Searching  to learn more about search criteria. \n# \nKnow what your list will look like before you place your order. Click  View Dashboard  to see charts, tables and a map that characterize your search results. You can also create custom charts. After analyzing your results, you may want to adjust your criteria. \n# \nAfter you’ve received your order and used it to facilitate a campaign, make sure to assess the campaign’s success and to understand how you might improve upon it by broadening or refining your search criteria in the future. You might, like many users, find that campaigns involving both postal and email correspondence have a much higher rate of response than postal-only campaigns. In that case, you could adjust your address selections the next time you license names. \nWhen you calculate your response rates, be careful to include all respondents — not only those who use the response media provided in your correspondence. Increasingly, students respond to correspondence by visiting college websites and completing inquiry forms or online applications not associated with the campaign."
