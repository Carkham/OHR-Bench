Volume Commitment and Quarterly Deficiency Charges\n\n 3.1 Shipper guarantees that during each Contract Year, Shipper will meet its Quarterly Volume Commitment or, in the event it fails to do so, shall remit to MPL the Quarterly Deficiency Payment pursuant to Section 3.5.

All Product barrels moved by Shipper in excess of its Quarterly Volume Commitment will be attributed to Shipper’s movements on the Pipeline as a Regular Shipper, subject to the applicable Rules & Regulations of the Tariff. \n3.6 The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product by Shipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (“Prepaid Transportation Credits”) to Shipper’s account for that type of Product. If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper’s account (the “Credit Period”) will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute in accordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarter period the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly Volume Commitment for the Pipeline for such month (the “Monthly Commitment”), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specifically subject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurred that prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shall be extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment. For the purposes of this Section 3.6, during the Term, if the Pipeline is in allocation for any portion of the month, the Pipeline will be considered to be in allocation for the entirety of such month. \nNotwithstanding anything in Section 3.5 to the contrary, upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason to the extent that Shipper, at the time of such expiration or termination, holds any unused Prepaid Transportation Credits, Shipper shall be permitted to apply such Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amounts incurred by Shipper and"

Condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.\n\n 3.9 If, following the binding open season and prior to the in-service date of the Tariff, MPL determines that it has available capacity not subscribed to during the binding open season, not to exceed  $90\\%$   of Project Capacity (“Unsubscribed Capacity”), to the extent permitted by Governmental Authority; MPL will provide Shipper the right to increase its Quarterly Volume Commitment as submitted on its Capacity Request Form on Exhibit C. MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days’ advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers (including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volume of Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the “Additional Volume Commitments”). No later than thirty (30) days following the date of MPL’s written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additional volumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (“Pre-Service Increase Request”). In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the Unsubscribed Capacity, each shipper’s volume commitment shall be increased by the volume of its Pre-Service Increase Request. In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that would, in aggregate, exceed the Unsubscribed Capacity, all Shippers will be allocated their Pre-Service Increases pro rata based on their then- current volume commitments. If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper’s Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revised to reflect Shipper’s new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment and its Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9. If there is still Unsubscribed Capacity after shippers (including Shipper) exercise Additional Volume Commitments as set forth above, MPL may conduct a second open season to obtain additional volume commitments for any remaining Unsubscribed Capacity.\n\n 4. Transportation Charges\n\n \n4.1 Shipper shall pay MPL a transportation charge for each Barrel of Product shipped under the terms of this Agreement and Exhibit C, at the rates provided for in Exhibit B, which shall be the Tariff Rates for the volume commitment on the Day of delivery of Product. \nThe rates in Exhibit B will be adjusted annually in accordance with the standard FERC annual oil pipeline indexing methodology in effect at the time of the escalation. There shall be no downward adjustment of the Rates in the event the annual FERC oil pipeline index rate is negative. Rates will typically be indexed during July of each year and would be first indexed in July of the year following project completion."

If MPL determines to recover any Compliance Costs from its shippers, it will do so in a manner that is reasonable and equitable to all shippers on the Pipeline.\n\n 4.4 A “Committed Priority Shipper” will receive transportation service exempt from prorationing provisions under normal operating conditions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be  $\\S0.01$   per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper’s rate will be charged the premium rate of  $\\S0.01$   above the posted uncommitted rate.

For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 5.1 to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure event with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure event."

The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper’s termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL’s sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper. \n10.6 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement may be contingent on the Shipper executing a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement. Shipper must notify MPL if it is unable to execute a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project in-service date. Furthermore, Shipper must make commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a commodity supply agreement within the one hundred and eighty (180) days.
