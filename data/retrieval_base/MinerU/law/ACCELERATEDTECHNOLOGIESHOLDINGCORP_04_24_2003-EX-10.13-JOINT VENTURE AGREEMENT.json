If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an\n\n      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it\n\n      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or\n\n      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party\n\n      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.\n\n \n12.  Sale or Purchase of Interest of Joint Venturer Prohibited. No Joint\n\n      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,\n\n      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any\n\n      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the\n\n      consent of the other Joint Venturer.\n\n \n13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to\n\n      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes\n\n      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid\n\n      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.\n\n \n14.

Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding on the Joint Venturers and their\n\n      respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators, and assigns.\n\n \n16.  Counterparts.
