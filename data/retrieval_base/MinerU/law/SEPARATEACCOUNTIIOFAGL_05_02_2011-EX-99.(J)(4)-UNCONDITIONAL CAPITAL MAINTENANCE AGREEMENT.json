Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with\n\n        applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1\n\n        may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year\n\n        of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory\n\n        financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year,\n\n        respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as\n\n        capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet\n\n        to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may\n\n        be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting\n\n        Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State.

At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees\n\n        that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct\n\n        parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds,\n\n        securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or\n\n        (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any\n\n        capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject\n\n        in either case to any required regulatory approvals. At any time any\n\n        dividends are due under paragraph 4, the Company agrees that it will\n\n        make such dividend to the Company's direct parent and will use its best\n\n        efforts to cause such direct parent to then dividend or otherwise\n\n        provide such funds to AIG.
