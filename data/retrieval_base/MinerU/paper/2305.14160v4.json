However, the un- derlying mechanism of how LLMs learn from the provided context remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the working mech- anism of ICL through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that label words in the demonstration examples function as anchors: (1) semantic information aggregates into label word representations during the shallow compu- tation layers’ processing; (2) the consolidated information in label words serves as a reference for LLMs’ final predictions. Based on these in- sights, we introduce an anchor re-weighting method to improve ICL performance, a demon- stration compression technique to expedite in- ference, and an analysis framework for diag- nosing ICL errors in GPT2-XL. The promising applications of our findings again validate the uncovered ICL working mechanism and pave the way for future studies. \n# \nIn-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a power- ful capability alongside the development of scaled- up large language models (LLMs) ( Brown et al. , 2020 ). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demon- stration examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks, such as text classification ( Min et al. ,  2022a ) and mathematical reasoning ( Wei et al. ,  2022 ). Since ICL does not require updates to millions or trillions of model parameters and relies on human-understandable natural language instructions ( Dong et al. ,  2023 ), it has become a promising approach for harnessing the full poten- tiality of LLMs. Despite its significance, the inner working mechanism of ICL remains an open ques- tion, garnering considerable interest from research \n\nFigure 1: Visualization of the information flow in a GPT model performing ICL.

Label words gather information from demonstrations in shallow layers, which is then extracted in deep layers for final prediction. \n# \nIn this paper, we find that the label words serve as anchors that aggregate and distribute information in ICL. We first visualize the attention interactive pattern between tokens with a GPT model ( Brown et al. ,  2020 ) on sentiment analysis (Figure  1 ). Ini- tial observations suggest that label words aggregate information in shallow layers and distribute it in deep layers.

(1) By blocking the information aggregation path to label words in certain layers, we find that such isolation in shal- low layers significantly impairs model performance. This indicates that label words collect useful in- formation during forward propagation in shallow layers. (2) We investigate the relationship between the attention distributions on the label words of the target position and the model’s final prediction. Our results illustrate a strong positive correlation, where a candidate label’s probability increases with more attention weight on its corresponding label token. In summary, these experimental findings suggest that our hypothesis holds well with large language models on real-world datasets. \nDrawing on insights from the information flow perspective, we explore three approaches to en- hance ICL’s effectiveness, efficiency, and inter- pretability. (1) An anchor re-weighting method is introduced, which employs a learnable vector to adjust the significance of different label words in demonstrations, leading to a   $16.7\\%$   average accu- racy boost compared to standard ICL baselines. (2) For quicker ICL inference, inputs are compressed into pre-calculated anchor representations since model predictions primarily rely on label word acti- vations. Testing shows a  $1.8\\times$   speedup in inference with only a minimal performance trade-off. (3) An error analysis of ICL on GPT2-XL demonstrates that the label confusion matrix aligns closely with the distance distribution of anchor key vectors, im- plying that errors might result from similar anchor representations. These promising applications fur- ther validate our hypothesis and shed light on future ICL studies for better transparency of LLMs. \n\n# \nThis section confirms the intuitive findings using two saliency score-based metrics as discussed in  $\\S~2.1$  . The quantitative results lead to a proposed hypothesis for the ICL working mechanism:    $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$  : In shallow layers, label words aggregate information from demonstration examples to form semantic representations for later computations.    $\\mathcal{H}_{2}$  : In deep layers, the model makes predictions by extracting information from label words. The validation for these hypotheses is presented in   $\\S~2.2$   and   $\\S~2.3$  , respectively. \n# \nThis section aims to discover the inherent patterns in the attention interaction between tokens for a GPT model. The saliency technique ( Simonyan et al. ,  2013 ), a common interpretation tool, is em- ployed for highlighting critical token interactions. Following common practice, we use the Taylor expansion ( Michel et al. ,  2019 ) to calculate the saliency score for each element of the attention matrix: \n\n$$\nI_{l}=\\left|\\sum_{h}A_{h,l}\\odot\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\partial A_{h,l}}\\right|.\n$$"

        "text": "Here,    $A_{h,l}$   is the value of the attention matrix of the  $h$  -th attention head in the    $l$  -th layer,    $x$   is the input, and    $\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{x})$   is the loss function of the task, e.g., the cross-entropy objective for a classification problem. We average all attention heads to obtain the saliency matrix    $I_{l}$   for the    $l.$  -th layer.    $I_{l}(i,j)$  represents the significance of the information flow from the    $j$  -th word to the    $i$  -th word for ICL. By observing  $I_{l}$  , we can get an intuitive impression that as the layer goes deeper, demonstration label words will become more dominant for the prediction, as depicted in Figure  1 . \nTo draw a clearer picture of this phenomenon, we propose three quantitative metrics based on    $I_{l}$  . Our focus lies in three components: (i) the label words, such as “Negative” and “Positive” in Fig- ure  2 , denoted as    $p_{1},...,p_{C}$  , where    $C$   represents the total number of label words; 4   (ii) the target po- sition, where the model generates prediction labels (i.e., the final token in the input), which we denote as    $q$  ; and (iii) the text part, i.e., the tokens before label words in the demonstration. \nThe definitions of the three quantitative metrics follow below. \n# \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{S_{w p}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_{w p}}I_{l}\\big(i,j\\big)}{\\vert C_{w p}\\vert},}\\\\ {C_{w p}=\\{(p_{k},j):k\\in[1,C],j<p_{k}\\}.}\\end{array}\n$$\n \n $S_{p q}$  , the mean significance of information flow from label words to the target position: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{S_{p q}=\\frac{\\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_{p q}}I_{l}(i,j)}{|C_{p q}|},}\\\\ {C_{p q}=\\{(q,p_{k}):k\\in[1,C]\\}.}\\end{array}\n$$\n \n# \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{S_{w w}=\\!\\frac{\\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_{w w}}I_{l}(i,j)}{|C_{w w}|},}\\\\ {C_{w w}=\\!\\{(i,j):j<i\\}-C_{w p}-C_{p q}.}\\end{array}\n$$\n \n $S_{w p},S_{p q}$  , and    $S_{w w}$   help assess different informa- tion flows in the model.    $S_{w p}$   indicates the intensity of information aggregation onto label words. A high    $S_{p q}$   demonstrates a strong information extrac- tion from label words for final decision-making.  $S_{w w}$   assesses average information flow among words, serving as a benchmark to gauge the in- tensity of the patterns identified by    $S_{w p}$   and    $S_{p q}$  . \n\nExperimental Settings We choose GPT2-XL from the GPT series ( Radford et al. ,  2019 ) as our primary model for investigation, due to its moder- ate model size (of 1.5B parameters) that is suitable for our hardware resource and its decent ICL perfor- mance ( Dai et al. ,  2022 ). For datasets, we use Stan- ford Sentiment Treebank Binary (SST-2) ( Socher et al. ,  2013 ) for sentiment analysis, Text REtrieval Conference Question Classification (TREC) ( Li and Roth ,  2002 ;  Hovy et al. ,  2001 ) for question type classification, AG’s news topic classification dataset (AGNews) ( Zhang et al. ,  2015 ) for topic classification, and EmoContext (EmoC) ( Chatterjee et al. ,  2019 ) for emotion classification. Templates for constructing demonstrations are provided in Appendix  A .  1000  examples are sampled from the test set for evaluation, with one demonstration per class sampled from the training set. Experiments with more demonstrations yield similar outcomes (refer to Appendix  F.1  for details). Results reflect averages from five random seeds. \nResults and Analysis Figure  3  reveals that: (1) in shallow layers,    $S_{p q}$  , the significance of the infor- mation flow from label words to targeted positions, is low, while    $S_{w p}$  , the information flow from the text part to label words is high; (2) in deep layers,  $S_{p q}$  , the importance of information flow from label words to the targeted position becomes the dom- inant one. Notably,    $S_{p q}$   and    $S_{w p}$   usually surpass  $S_{w w}$  , suggesting that interactions involving label words outweigh others. \nProposed Hypothesis Based on this, we propose the hypothesis that label words function as anchors in the ICL information flow. In shallow layers, label words gather information from demonstra- tion examples to form semantic representations for deeper layers, while in deep layers, the model ex- tracts the information from label words to form the final prediction. Figure  2  gives an illustration for our hypothesis. \n# \nIn this part, we validate our hypothesis’ first compo- nent.

By manipulating the attention layer in the model to block this flow and examining the model behavior change, we val- idate the existence of the information aggregation process and its contribution to the final prediction. \nExperimental Settings We retain the same test sample size of 1000 inputs as   $\\S~2.1$  . We use the same demonstration for a single random seed. To further validate our findings on larger models, we incorporate GPT-J (6B) ( Wang and Komatsuzaki , 2021 ) in experiments, which exceeds GPT2-XL in model size and capacity. \nImplementation Details To block the informa- tion flow to label words, we isolate label words by manipulating the attention matrix    $A$  . Specifi- cally, we set    $A_{l}(p,i)(i<p)$   to 0 in the attention matrix    $A_{l}$   of the    $l$  -th layer, where  $p$   represents label \nFigure 4: The impact of isolating label words versus randomly isolating non-label words within the first or last 5 layers.

Conse- quently, in the  $l$  -th layer, label words cannot access information from the prior demonstration text. \nMetrics We use the following metrics to assess the impact of blocking information flow from the text part to label tokens:  (1) Label Loyalty:  mea- sures the consistency of output labels with and without isolation.  (2) Word Loyalty:  employs the Jaccard similarity to compare the top-5 predicted words with and without isolation, capturing more subtle model output alterations (See Appendix  C for details). Low loyalty indicates a profound im- pact of isolation on model predictions. \nResults and Analysis Figure  4  illustrates a no- table influence on the model’s behavior when label words are isolated within the first 5 layers. Yet, this influence becomes inconsequential within the last 5 layers, or when random non-label words are used. This observation underlines the fundamental impor- tance of shallow-layer information aggregation via label words in ICL. It also emphasizes the superi- ority of label words over non-label words. Further tests with variable numbers of layers reaffirm these findings (Appendix  D ). Moreover, similar results were obtained when testing ICL with semantically unrelated labels (refer to Appendix  F.2 ). \n# \nWe proceed to validate the latter part of our hy- pothesis that the model extracts information from label words to form the final prediction. We de- note the sum of the attention matrices in the    $l$  -th layer as    $A_{l}$  .   In deeper layers, we find a strong correlation between the attention distributions on the label words of the target position, represented as    $(A_{l}(q,p_{1}),...,A_{l}(q,p_{C}))$  , and the model’s final prediction, affirming our hypothesis.

        "text": "# \nWe utilize the AUC-ROC score to quantify the cor- relation between    $A_{l}(q,p_{i})$   and model prediction, which we denote as    $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$   for the    $l$  -th layer. We prefer the AUC-ROC metric due to two pri- mary reasons: (1)    $A_{l}(q,p_{i})$   might differ from the probability of the model outputting label    $i$   by a constant factor. As  Kobayashi et al.  ( 2020 ) points out, attention should be multiplied by the norm of the key vector to yield ’more interpretable atten- tion’. The AUC-ROC metric can implicitly account for these factors, thus allowing us to uncover the correlation more effectively. (2) The proportion of different labels output by the model may be un- balanced. Using the AUC-ROC metric can help mitigate this issue, reducing disturbances caused by class imbalance. \nConsidering the residual mechanism of trans- formers, we can view each layer’s hidden state as the cumulative effect of all prior layer calculations. To quantify the accumulated contribution of the first  $l$   layers to model prediction, we introduce  $R_{l}$  : \n\n$$\nR_{l}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{l}(\\mathrm{ALCROC}_{i}-0.5)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\mathrm{ALCROC}_{i}-0.5)}.\n$$\n \nThis measure tracks the positive contribution above a baseline AUC-ROC threshold of 0.5. The value of  $R_{l}$   signifies the proportional contribution of the first  $l$   layers to the model prediction. \n# \nFigures  5a  and  5b  delineate correlation metrics for GPT2-XL and GPT-J, averaged across four datasets. The    $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$   for deep layers approaches  0 . 8 , il- lustrating a strong correlation between the attention distributions on label words of the target position and the model’s final prediction. Moreover, shal- low layers show negligible cumulative contribu- tions   $(R_{l})$  , with a significant increase in middle and deep layers. These results signify the crucial role of deep layers for final prediction, validating that the model extracts information from label words in deep layers to form the final prediction. \nFigure 5:    $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$   and    $R_{l}$   of each layer in GPT mod- els. The result is averaged over SST-2, TREC, AGNews, and Emoc.    $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$   reaches 0.8 in deep layers, and  $R_{l}$   increases mainly in the middle and later layers. \n# \nIn  $\\S~2.2$  , we have affirmed that the model’s shallow layers assemble information from demonstrations via label words to form semantic representations. In   $\\S~2.3$  , we verify that the aforementioned aggre- gated information on label words is then extracted to form the final prediction in the deep layers. Rec- ognizing the crucial function of label words in this process, we have introduced the term “Anchors” to denote them. Given the considerable role these “anchors” fulfill, we find it intuitive to design ICL improvements based on them, as elaborated in   $\\S\\ 3$  . \n# \nWith insights from the validated hypothesis, we propose strategies to boost ICL’s accuracy and in- ference speed. We propose an anchor re-weighting method in  $\\S\\,3.1$   to adjust the demonstrations’ contri- butions and improve accuracy. In   $\\S\\ 3.2$  , we explore a context compression technique that reduces origi- nal demonstrations to anchor hidden states to speed up ICL inference. Besides, in  $\\S\\ 3.3$  , we utilize an- chor distances to perform an analysis to understand the errors ICL made in real-world scenarios. These approaches corroborate our hypothesis, pointing to potential paths for future ICL enhancements."

( 7 ), which is equivalent to adjusting the attention weights  $A(q,p_{i})$  : \n\n$$\n\\hat{A}(q,p_{i})=\\exp(\\beta_{0}^{i})A(q,p_{i})\n$$\n \nEach  $\\beta_{0}^{i}$    is a learnable parameter, set uniquely for different attention heads and layers. Refer to Ap- pendix  G  for more details. \nTo train the re-weighting vector    $\\beta=\\left\\{\\beta_{0}^{i}\\right\\}$  \t , we utilize an auxiliary training set  $(X_{t r a i n},Y_{t r a i n})$  . Here, we perform ICL with normal demonstrations and optimize    $\\beta$   with respect to the classification loss  $\\mathcal{L}$   on    $(X_{t r a i n},Y_{t r a i n})$  : \n\n$$\n\\beta^{\\star}=\\arg\\operatorname*{min}_{\\beta}\\mathcal{L}(X_{t r a i n},Y_{t r a i n}).\n$$\n \nThis approach can be metaphorically described as \"re-weighting the anchors,\" leading us to term it as  Anchor Re-weighting . It can also be viewed as a modification of the demonstration contributions since demonstration information has been incorpo- rated into the anchors as suggested by our prior analysis in   $\\S\\ 2.2$  . Additionally, it can be interpreted as a unique adapter variant, introducing minimal parameters while preserving most of the original model. However, it is specifically designed based on our anchor hypothesis and requires fewer pa- rameters than traditional adapters. \n\n# \nWe choose one sample per class as normal demon- strations and choose four extra samples per class to form the auxiliary training set    $(\\boldsymbol{X}_{t r a i n},\\boldsymbol{Y}_{t r a i n})$  . The setup follows   $\\S~2.2$  , with results averaged over five random seeds. Owing to computational con- straints, we employ GPT2-XL for evaluation, ex- cluding GPT-J. The parameters  $\\left\\{\\beta_{0}^{i}\\right\\}$  \t are trained using gradient descent. More details can be found in Appendix  H . \nWe compare  Anchoring Re-weighting  with two baselines: (1) Vanilla ICL with the same demon- stration (1-shot per class) (2) Vanilla ICL, where the auxiliary training set of  $\\beta$   is included as demon- strations (5-shot per class) for a fair comparison. \n# \nAs Table  1  shows, the proposed anchor re- weighting significantly enhances ICL performance, particularly on the SST-2 and EmoC datasets. Be- sides, adding more demonstrations for vanilla ICL may not bring a stable accuracy boost due to the po- tential noise introduced, as discussed in  Zhao et al. ( 2021 ). Different from vanilla ICL which utilizes the extra examples to form a demonstration, we train a re-weighting vector    $\\beta$   to modulate label an- chor contributions. This shortens the input context and thus brings (almost) no extra cost to the infer- ence speed. The consistent improvements of our method suggest that the re-weighting mechanism could be a better alternative to utilize demonstra- tion examples. Furthermore, it reiterates the crucial role that anchors play in ICL. \n# \nWe further explore a context compression tech- nique that reduces the full demonstration to anchor hidden states for accelerating ICL inference. \n# \nIn   $\\S~2.3$  , we find that the model output heavily re- lies on the label words, which collect information"

This might be due to the critical role of formatting information in helping the model to determine the output space at the target position,   as highlighted in  Min et al. ( 2022b ).

If we find that Hidden anchor  surpasses Text anchor  in performance, it solidifies the notion that the ag- gregated information within label words carries significant importance.

Besides, we observe that the acceleration effect is more pronounced in the GPT-J model compared to GPT2-XL, demonstrating its great potential to apply to larger language models. \n# \nLastly, we perform an error analysis for ICL by examining the distances between the key vectors in the attention module that correspond to the label words. \n# \nOur previous analysis in  $\\S~2.3$   shows a strong cor- relation between the model output and    $A(q,p_{i})$  , which is determined by  $\\mathbf{q}_{q}\\mathbf{k}_{p_{i}}^{T}$    as per Eq.  7 . Should the key vectors    $\\mathbf{k}$   for label words    $p_{i}$   and    $p_{k}$   be similar,    $A(q,p_{i})$   and    $A(q,p_{k})$   will also likely be similar, leading to potential label confusion. Fur- thermore, considering the distribution of query vec- tors    $\\mathbf{q}_{q}$  , we employ a PCA-like method to extract the components of the key vectors along the direc- tions with significant variations in  $\\mathbf{q}_{q}$  , denoted as  $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$   (see Appendix  J  for details). We anticipate that the distances between these  $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\mathbf{s}$  s can correspond to the category confusion of the model, thus revealing one possible origin of ICL errors. Here, we normal- ize the distances to a scale of 0-1, with 0 indicating the highest degree of category confusion: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Confinement}_{i j}^{\\mathrm{pred}}=\\frac{\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{k_{pi}}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k_{pi_{j}}}}\\|}{\\operatorname*{max}_{s\\neq t}\\|\\hat{\\mathbf{k_{p_{s}}}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{k_{pi}}}\\|},\n$$\n \n# \nWe utilize the GPT2-XL model and TREC dataset, as the model displays varying confusion levels be- tween categories on this dataset. We use all 500 samples of the TREC test set and use 1 demonstra- tion per class for convenience of analysis. \nWe calculate the actual model confusion score, Confus  $\\mathbf{ion}_{i j}$  , between category    $i$   and category  $k$   us- ing the AUC-ROC metric (detailed in Appendix  K ). We then compare the predicted confusion score, pred Confusion   , and the actual confusion score, ij Confus  $\\mathbf{ion}_{i j}$  , via heatmaps. \npred (a) Confusion matrix of Confusion   . ij \n(b) Confusion matrix of   $\\mathrm{Confinement}_{i j}$  . \nFigure 6: Predicted and real confusion matrix on TREC. We set undefined diagonals to  1  for better visualization. The heatmaps display similarity in confusing category pairs, particularly in lighter-colored blocks. \n# \nFigure  6  shows that the proposed approximation pred metric,  Confusion   , can identify the most confus- ij ing case (Description-Entity) and performs reason- ably well for highly confusing categories (Entity- Abbreviation, Description-Abbreviation). This high correlation indicates that ICL makes errors in categories with similar label anchors. Overall, this result demonstrates that our anchor-based anal- ysis framework could serve as an interpretation tool for better understanding ICL’s errors. \n# \nThe existing literature on in-context learning analy- sis can be broadly divided into two streams, each focusing on different aspects. The first stream ex- plores the influencing factors of ICL based on input perturbation, such as the order ( Min et al. ,  2022b ), the formatting ( Yoo et al. ,  2022 ;  Wei et al. ,  2022 ), and the selection of the demonstration ( Liu et al. , 2022 ). Designing proper demonstration construc- tion strategies ( Ye et al. ,  2023 ;  Li et al. ,  2023a ) and calibration techniques ( Zhao et al. ,  2021 ;  Min et al. ,  2022a ) could bring clear boosts to the ICL performance. The second stream investigates the inner working mechanism of ICL through different conceptual lenses, such as making an analogy of ICL to gradient descent ( von Oswald et al. ,  2022 ; Dai et al. ,  2022 ) and viewing the process of ICL as a Bayesian inference ( Xie et al. ,  2022 )."

        "text": "In this paper, we provide a novel perspective by examining the information flow in language mod- els to gain an understanding of ICL. Our approach offers new insights and demonstrates the potential for leveraging this understanding to improve the ef- fectiveness, efficiency, and interpret ability of ICL. \n# \nIn this paper, we propose a hypothesis that label words serve as anchors in in-context learning for aggregating and distributing the task-relevant infor- mation flow. Experimental results with attention manipulation and analysis of predictions correla- tion consolidate the hypothesis holds well in GPT2- XL and GPT-J models. Inspired by the new under- standing perspective, we propose three practical applications. First, an anchor re-weighting method is proposed to improve ICL accuracy. Second, we explore a demonstration compression technique to accelerate ICL inference. Lastly, we showcase an analysis framework to diagnose ICL errors on a real-world dataset. These promising applications again verify the hypothesis and open up new direc- tions for future investigations on ICL. \n# \nOur study, while providing valuable insights into in-context learning (ICL), has several limitations. Firstly, our research scope was limited to classi- fication tasks and did not delve into the realm of generative tasks. Additionally, our hypothesis was only examined within conventional ICL paradigms, leaving other ICL paradigms such as the chain of thought prompting (CoT) ( Wei et al. ,  2022 ) unex- plored. Secondly, due to hardware constraints, we mainly investigated models up to a scale of 6 bil- lion parameters. Further research that replicates our study using larger-scale models would be bene- ficial in corroborating our findings and refining the hypotheses set forth in our investigation. \n# \nWe thank all reviewers for their thoughtful and in- sightful suggestions.

We postulate that there’s a strong correlation be- tween the attention distributions on the label words of the target position    $(A_{l}(q,p_{1}),...,A_{l}(q,p_{C}))$   and the model’s final prediction. We use the AUC- ROC score to quantify this correlation. We re- gard    $(A_{l}(q,p_{1}),...,A_{l}(q,p_{C}))$   as a classifier’s pre- diction for the model output label (that is,    $A_{l}(q,p_{i})$  is equivalent to the probability of model outputting label    $i$  ), and compute the AUC-ROC value of this prediction relative to the actual model output. We denote this as    $\\mathrm{AUCRO C}_{l}$  . For the case with more demonstrations (Appendix  F.1 ), we simply sum up all    $A_{l}(q,p)$   of the same class. \n\n# \n# \nWe implement our experimental analysis utilizing two demonstrations per class, resulting in a total of 4, 12, 8, and 8 demonstrations respectively for SST-2, TREC, AGNews, and EmoC. Our findings, as depicted in Figure  9 , Figure  10 , and Figure  11 , exhibit a high degree of similarity to the results obtained from experiments that employ one demon- stration per class. \n# \nThe applicability of our analytical conclusions to ICL variants, such as the semantically unrelated la- bel ICL ( Wei et al. ,  2023 ), is an intriguing subject. Given that both GPT2-XL and GPT-J-6B perform at levels akin to random guessing in this ICL set- ting, we chose LLaMA-33B ( Touvron et al. ,  2023 ) and SST-2 for our experiment.

The    $i^{t h}$  direction,  $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$  , is chosen to maximize the variance of the projection of the centralized query vectors onto it, while also being orthogonal to the previously chosen directions,    $\\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\\mathbf{v}_{i-1}$  . This process can be formalized as follows: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\mathbf v}_{1}=\\underset{\\left\\|{\\mathbf v}\\right\\|=1}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\,\\mathrm{Var}\\left\\{{\\mathbf v}^{\\top}\\hat{\\mathbf Q}\\right\\},}\\\\ &{{\\mathbf v}_{2}=\\underset{\\left\\|{\\mathbf v}\\right\\|=1,{\\mathbf v}\\bot{\\mathbf v}_{1}}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\,\\mathrm{Var}\\left\\{{\\mathbf v}^{\\top}\\hat{\\mathbf Q}\\right\\},}\\\\ &{\\dots}\\\\ &{{\\mathbf v}_{M}=\\underset{\\left\\|{\\mathbf v}\\right\\|=1,{\\mathbf v}\\bot{\\mathbf v}_{1},\\dots,{\\mathbf v}\\bot{\\mathbf v}_{M-1}}{\\arg\\operatorname*{max}}\\,\\mathrm{Var}\\left\\{{\\mathbf v}^{\\top}\\hat{\\mathbf Q}\\right\\}.}\\end{array}\n$$\n \nWe define    $\\sigma_{i}$   as the square root of the variance of the projection of  $\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}}$   onto the    $i^{t h}$    direction, i.e.,\n\n  $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\\top}\\hat{\\mathbf{Q}}\\right\\}}$  . \nTo derive features  $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\mathbf{s}$  s, we project the key vector\n\n  $\\mathbf{k}$   onto the directions  $\\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\\mathbf{v}_{M}$   and scale the pro- jections by the corresponding standard deviations\n\n  $\\sigma_{1},...,\\sigma_{M}$  . Each feature,  $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_{i}$  , is thus calculated as\n\n  $\\sigma_{i}\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{T}\\mathbf{k}$  . \nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC- ROC) value of this classifier    $f$  , we get the degree of confusion between category    $i$   and    $k$  , termed as Confusion ij . \nThe computed  Confusion i  $j$   is a value that never exceeds 1. The closer  Confusion i  $j$   approximates 1, the less pronounced the confusion, and vice versa. \nWe use the above metric instead of directly ana- lyzing the output labels of the model because pre- vious work has indicated the issue of insufficient output probability calibration in ICL ( Zhao et al. , 2021 ), which is greatly affected by factors such as sample ordering and model preferences for specific label words. By leveraging our defined degree of confusion,  Confus  $\\mathrm{ion}_{i j}$  , we can implicitly alleviate the disturbances arising from insufficient probabil- ity calibration on the output labels. This allows for a more accurate representation of the model’s degree of confusion for different categories, miti- gating the impact of randomness. \n# \nIn the supplementary material, we have provided codes that allow for the faithful replication of our experiments and subsequent result analysis. To ensure consistency and reproducibility across dif- ferent devices, we have fixed the five random seeds to the values of 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46. We invite readers to delve into the code for additional imple- mentation details that may arouse their interest. \nWe further examine the influence of    $M$   on the prediction confusion matrix,  Confusion i  $j^{\\mathrm{pred}}$  , as depicted in Figure  14 . Given the similarity in outcomes for various  $M$  , we settle on a value of  $M=10$   for computation of Confusion i  $j^{\\mathrm{pred}}$  . \n# \nTo gauge the true degree of confusion between categories  $i$   and    $k$   for a given model, we suggest utilizing the   $\\mathsf{C o n f u s i o n}_{i j}$   metric: \nFirst, we procure all test samples    $x_{t}$   bearing true labels    $i$   or    $k$  . We then obtain the probabilities    $p_{i}^{t}$  and  $p_{j}^{t}$    yielded by the model for categories    $i$   and    $k$  , respectively, on these samples. These probabilities are normalized to a total of 1. Essentially, we derive a classifier  $f$   that delivers the probabilities    $p_{i}^{t}$    and  $p_{j}^{t}$    for the categories    $i$   and    $k$   respectively, on the test samples    $x_{t}$  .
