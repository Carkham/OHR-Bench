And he may not need to be, as his allies and surrogates trans- form it in his favor. The social-me- dia platform, though still regarded as a hub for Democratic voices and liberal causes, has seen an up- tick of right-wing, pro-Trump in- fluencers since the last presiden- tial election. \nShbair  and  Matthew Mpoke Bigg . CAIRO — For weeks, the Gaza Strip’s southernmost city, Rafah, was one of the few places where desperate Gazans could find some aid and food. Bakeries sold bread; fuel powered generators; markets were open, if expensive. \nThe increase comes as Presi- dent Biden signed legislation that would force a sale of TikTok by its Chinese owner or would have it banned in the United States. That law has triggered a backlash from young voters who backed Mr. Bi- den overwhelmingly in 2020, some of whom are also opposing his administration’s support of Is- rael’s war in Gaza. An internal analysis within TikTok found nearly twice as many pro-Trump posts as pro-Biden ones on the platform since November: 1.29 million pro-Trump posts versus 651,000 pro-Biden posts. \n— effectively closing the two main crossings where aid enters — Rafah has become a place of fear and dwindling supplies. Bakeries have shuttered. So have malnutri- tion treatment centers. The price of the firewood that many people now use to cook has doubled. To- matoes, cucumbers and peppers have grown so expensive that they are sold by the piece, not by the kilogram. \n# \n“If we allow the Democrats and the leftist organizations and leftist influencers to have a monopoly on the content that’s produced on TikTok, we will lose the next gen- eration of Americans,” said C.J. Pearson, a social-media influenc- er with nearly 149,000 followers on TikTok who co-chairs the Re- publican National Committee’s youth advisory council. \n# \nFamilies hide what canned goods they still have. They eye their emptying sacks of flour, cal- culating how long they will last. “There’s  always  something missing in the tent,” said Ahmed Abu al-Kas, 51, who is sheltering in Rafah with his family. “If we have bread, we don’t have water. If we have firewood, we don’t have some basic vegetables.” For months, international aid officials and health experts have warned that famine will come for Gaza unless Israel lifts barriers keeping most humanitarian aid out, the fighting stops and vital services such as health care and clean water, which must be in place to fend off malnutrition, are restored. None of those conditions have \nHealth officials began publicly sharing less data. City Council members rarely addressed or in- quired about the growing number of overdoses. The fact that the city’s status became so much worse than any other of its size was not known to the mayor, the deputy mayor — who had been the health commissioner during some of those years — or multiple council members until they were recently shown data compiled by Times/Banner reporters.

Fatal drug overdoses have occurred on a third of the city’s blocks. Bodies have been found in motels and va- cant houses, at parks and the foot- ball stadium, around the corner from City Hall and outside the Health Department. In one grim month alone, 114 people suc- cumbed. \nBut TikTok still presents chal- lenges as the former president seeks to regain the White House. Among the right, TikTok’s reach remains overshadowed by that of other social media platforms. Al- though a super PAC backing Mr. Trump joined TikTok this month, it remains unclear whether his un- popularity with young voters, who are on the platform in large num- bers, will make it difficult for him to find widespread support. And Republican politicians — includ- ing Mr. Trump — have largely re- sisted joining the platform, with many having vocally opposed it. Mr. Trump didn’t just oppose TikTok: He attempted to ban it several times as president, citing security concerns about the app’s Chinese ownership as young peo- ple used it to mobilize against him in 2020. Yet over the last month,  \nPeople in Baltimore have been dying of overdoses at a rate never before seen in a major American city. \nIn the past six years, nearly 6,000 lives have been lost. The death rate from 2018 to 2022 was nearly double that of any other large city, and higher than nearly all of Appalachia during the pre- scription pill crisis, the Midwest during the height of rural meth labs or New York during the crack epidemic. \nFor years, Baltimore was known for its innovative  approach, including a broad public information campaign. \ntious goals for their overdose pre- vention efforts.

Some scurry to the turn- stiles. Others wait patiently at the merchandise stalls, anxious to buy a jersey, a scarf, a commemo- rative trinket. \n# \n# \nSince its founding, the N.C.A.A. has operated with a business mod- el that defined the college athlete as an amateur. Over the years, as college sports evolved into a mega-enterprise, lawsuits and la- bor actions chipped away at that model, which came to be increas- ingly seen as exploitative in big- money sports like football and men’s basketball. \n# \nbearing the name of Alexia Putel- las or Aitana Bonmatí, Barça Fe- \nwhether women would be com- pensated fairly, whether smaller conferences would bear a dispro- portionate burden of the settle- ment and whether this framework would do anything to limit the power of collectives — the boost- er-funded groups that entice play- ers with payments to hopscotch from school to school. \nAitana Bonmatí, right, the reigning world player of the year, has helped lead Barcelona Femení to the Champions League final. \nThe busiest and longest line, though, forms outside a booth of- fering fans the chance to have a photograph taken with their he- roes.

LeRoy, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “The idea that schools are paying millions of dollars to the people who are sell- ing the TV contracts and filling the seats — that’s good. But it closes one Pandora’s box and opens four or five others.” \nIf approved by a U.S. district judge in California, the settlement would allow for the creation of the first revenue-sharing plan for col- lege athletics, a landmark shift in which schools would directly pay their athletes for playing.
