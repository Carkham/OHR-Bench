The glaring security mistakes before the shooting, however, and the heated criticism that Ms. Cheatle faced in the days since had left her position increasingly in doubt. \nThis article is by  Hamed Aleaziz , Zolan Kanno-Youngs and  Kate Kelly . \nWASHINGTON — The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly A. Cheatle, resigned on Tuesday, af-ter security failures surrounding the attempted assassination of former  President  Donald  J. Trump and calls for her to step down from lawmakers in both par- ties. \nOfficials investigating the mat- ter, including lawmakers in hear- ings this week, have repeatedly questioned why the building from which the gunman eventually fired was excluded from the Se- cret Service’s security perimeter and why no law enforcement offi- \nIn an email to Secret Service employees on Tuesday, Ms. Chea- tle said that one of the agency’s foremost duties is to protect the nation’s leaders and that it “fell short of that mission” in failing to secure a campaign rally from a gunman on July 13. \n\n“I do not want my calls for resig- nation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission,” Ms. Cheatle said in the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times. \nA Crisis Born in Vengeance A charred vehicle Tuesday in Bangladesh.

Trump and his politi- cal team spent nearly two years tailoring a campaign to defeat an old white male president who is conspicuously frail and who most Americans had told pollsters they doubted could handle another four-year term. \nMr. Biden said he would appoint a new director soon. On Tuesday afternoon, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas, to whom the Secret Service an- swers, designated Ronald Rowe as the agency’s acting director. Mr. Rowe, who was a deputy to Ms. Cheatle, has been at the Se- cret Service for more than two decades. \nA presidential contest pitting Ms. Harris against former Presi- dent Donald J.

They assess the targets ahead of them. They trust in the prepara- tion that got them there. Then, finally, they’re ready to check in at the airport. \nThe  prosecutor-versus-felon approach may appeal to undecid- ed voters who had been sour on both Mr. Trump and President Bi- den. It may also goad Mr. Trump, who reacts strongly to criticism, into resurrecting the language he has used against other Black fe- male prosecutors, such as Letitia James in New York and Fani Willis in Georgia, both of whom he has called “racist” and attacked in personal terms. \nThis article is by  J.

More than 9,000 migrants crossed the border on a September day into the town of Del Rio and huddled in a tent camp under a bridge. Thousands more came later that week from countries all over the world, chal- lenging the town’s ability to han- dle them. \nBefore the members of the U.S. shooting team got a chance to fire their rifles, pistols and shotguns this month in the Paris Games, they had to get them there first. And while international air travel is already among the most univer- sally exasperating experiences on earth, imagine doing it with a bunch of guns and ammunition in your luggage. \nIn a preview of what’s to come, Ms. Harris made the prosecutor’s attack line explicit during an ap- pearance on Monday, describing her past as the district attorney of San Francisco and the attorney general of California. \nSenator Robert Menendez faced a possible expulsion vote. \nThe following spring, Texas opened a new frontier of its own. On April 13, a bus pulled into Un- ion Station in Washington, D.C., carrying 24 migrants who had been offered a free ride from the border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, chartered by the state’s Division of  Emergency  Management. More buses arrived in the capital over the next several days. \nforce an ugly intraparty fight that threatened to make him the first senator ousted since the Civil War. Mr. Menendez conveyed his resignation in a letter to Gov. Phil- ip D. Murphy of New Jersey, shortly after he shared the news with what remained of his staff. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said he would promptly appoint a replace- ment who would serve until Janu- ary. \nA desk agent once “physically freaked out” when Sagen Mad- dalena, a U.S. shooter, notified her about the guns in her bags. \n“In those roles I took on perpe- trators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said. \n“I’ve learned the hard way about saying, ‘Oh, this is going pretty smooth,’” said Sagen Mad- dalena, 30, an American rifle shooter who will be competing at her second Olympics. “You can get there six hours before the flight leaves, and it feels like you’re running to the plane every time.” \n“We just accept that when we get to the airport, it’s going to be a nightmare,” said Ivan Roe, 28, a ri- fle shooter attending his first Games this year. \ntently applied). And then there is the paperwork required to merely possess guns in various countries (voluminous). \nThere is also the ever-present fear, worst of all, that some of their meticulously bespoke equipment could get misplaced altogether — a rare but real outcome that has temporarily derailed some shoot- ers’ careers. \nMr. Trump has been trying to soften some of his harshest rheto- Continued on Page A14 \nWashington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, suggested that many of the migrants had been “tricked” into riding the buses by the Texas governor, Greg Abbott.
