But much of Israel woke up on Sunday to find that at least for the immediate term, the long- dreaded attack appeared to be over almost before it started. Both Israel and Hezbollah quickly claimed victories of sorts: Israel for its predawn pre-emptive strikes against what the military said were thousands of Hezbollah’s rocket launcher barrels in southern Lebanon; and Hezbollah for its subsequent firing of barrages of rockets and drones at northern Israel, which the Israeli military said killed a naval officer. By breakfast time, the two \nWithin hours, both sides ap- peared to de-escalate, at least temporarily, but signaled that the violence and dangerous tensions could continue. Hezbollah said its operation, vengeance for the Is- raeli assassination of a senior commander, had “finished for the day” but left open the possibility of further action. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that “what happened today is not the final word.” \n# \n# \nFor weeks, Israelis have waited in trepidation for a major attack promised by Hezbollah in retalia- \nHezbollah announced that it had completed the “first stage” of its attack to avenge the assassi- nation of the senior commander, Fuad Shukr, and appeared to be calling it a day, at least for now. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said he had spoken with the U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, and they had “discussed the importance of avoiding regional escalation,” according to a statement from Mr. Gallant’s office. \n# \n# \n# \nThis article is by  Chelsia Rose Marcius ,  Maria Cramer  and  Wesley Parnell . \n\n# \n# \nHigh above an arena packed with Democratic delegates in Chi- cago last week, a video introduced the life story of Kamala Harris to the world. \nFor 15 months, Daniel Davon- Bonilla sat in the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, ac- cused of raping a transgender woman in a migrant shelter. Then, on June 24, Mr. Davon- Bonilla stood before a judge in a Brooklyn court. The victim in the case had refused to testify, and now prosecutors were offering him a deal: He could plead guilty to a felony assault charge and be released that day. \n# \ners throughout the week referred to Ms. Harris as hailing from Oak- land, the East Bay’s largest city. The word almost never spoken was the name of Ms. Harris’s actu- al hometown: Berkeley, Calif.

But where was that exactly? The screen simply read “East Bay,” as in the eastern section of the San Francisco Bay Area that sprawls over 1,400 square miles and is home to nearly three mil- lion people. Ms. Harris called the area just “the bay” in her speech on Thursday night. Other speak- \nIn  fact,  Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, had informed the city that it in- tended to deport Mr. Davon-Bo- nilla when he was charged with rape, the agency said. But neither the city nor the Brooklyn district attorney notified federal officials when he was released that day in June. \nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech on Sunday evening that his group had attacked an Israeli intelli- gence base, Glilot, just north of Tel Aviv. If the results of the attack on the base turned out to be satisfactory, he said, the mili- tia would rest its case. If it turned out to be a failure, he added, then Hezbollah re- served the right to respond at a later date. \nA Hezbollah drone was inter- cepted on Sunday by Israel. \nThe judge, Donald Leo, warned Mr. Davon-Bonilla, a 24-year-old from Nicaragua, that he could be deported. \ntion for the airstrike last month in a suburb of Beirut that killed one of its leaders, Fuad Shukr. Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, has also promised retri- bution for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader, on a visit to Tehran, hours after Mr. Shukr was killed, though it appears to have put that plan on hold. \nMr. Davon-Bonilla did not show up for his sentencing on Aug. 9.

Outgunned, the soldiers repelled the first two assaults, but suffered many casualties. As Ms. Chornohuz bandaged the head of a wounded platoon commander, she said a third at- tack broke through, forcing the Ukrainian  troops  to  retreat quickly, leaving behind the com- mander and other badly injured soldiers. \n# \n# \n“Lots of good guys were killed,” said Ms. Chornohuz, 29. “We did- n’t have the time to say goodbye to any of them.” \nThere are no vaccines for mpox available in the Democratic Re- public of Congo, the epicenter of a global health emergency declared last week, even though the coun- try first asked for the shots two years ago and the manufacturers say they have supplies. \nit issued an emergency use li- cense that would speed access.
