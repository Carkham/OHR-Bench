The rocket prompted Israel to retali- ate early Sunday with strikes across Lebanon. \nThe initial Israeli response ap- peared to stop short of a major es- calation, but there were still fears that the fallout from the rocket launch would lead to all-out war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- yahu of Israel, facing domestic pressure to mount a fiercer re- sponse, met with senior ministers and security officials on Sunday to discuss further steps, after flying back early from a trip to the United States. \n# \n# \nIsrael blamed Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese group that has been attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, for the deadly rocket attack on Saturday on the Druse Arab town of Majdal Shams. Hezbollah has denied it was responsible. \nthem — Governors Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Andy Beshear of Kentucky — directly over- lapped with Ms. Harris as attor- neys general. Now-Gov.

A criminal investigation yielded a witness who had heard sounds of heavy machinery at night. Mr. Mellon refused to talk and hired a former state attorney general as his lawyer. Nearly a year later, the matter was resolved quietly: Mr. Mellon agreed to return the stone, and prosecutors agreed not to bring charges. \nBut to his neighbors in a Rhode Island beachfront enclave, he is better known as the prime suspect in the Narragansett Runestone Affair. \nU.S. diplomats were in contin- uous contact with the Israeli and Lebanese governments on Sun- day to contain the hostilities, Ms. Watson’s statement said. The U.S. had asked Lebanon’s government to relay a message to Hezbollah to show restraint in the face of a fur- ther Israeli response, according to Lebanon’s foreign minister, Ab- dallah Bou Habib. \nA hulking boulder once posi- tioned just offshore in Narra- gansett Bay, the runestone bears inscriptions that some believe \n\nThe episode was a rare glimpse into the private life and the public dealings of Mr. Mellon, 81, a reclu- sive heir and railroad magnate who has recently turned himself into a political force.
