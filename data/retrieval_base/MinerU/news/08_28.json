Covid? \nThe prospect threatened to up- end the family’s plans. \n“Six months ago, we would have tested for Covid,” Mr. Moyer, 41, of Ohio, said. This time they did not. Instead, they checked to make sure the boy’s cough was improv- ing and his fever was gone — and then set off for New Jersey, not bothering to tell the grandparents about the incident. \nIn the fifth summer of Covid, cases are surging, and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion has reported “high” or “very high” levels of the virus in waste- water in almost every state. The rate of hospitalizations with Covid is nearly twice what it was at this time last summer, and deaths — despite being down almost 75 per- cent from what they were at the worst of the pandemic — are still double what they were this spring. \nCourt workers against a plan by Mexico’s president to overhaul the judiciary protested at the Supreme Court in Mexico City last week. \n# \n# \nAs children return to schools and Labor Day weekend travel swells, the potential for further spread abounds. But for many like Mr. Moyer, Covid has become so normalized that they no longer see it as a reason to disrupt social, work or travel routines. Test kit sales have plummeted. Isolation after an exposure is increasingly rare. Masks — once a ubiquitous symbol of a Covid surge — are sparse, even in crowded airports, train stations and subways. \nmother in the recovery room and saw her in a panic. Despite having an oxygen tube in her nose, Ms. Cooper was gesturing as if she could not breathe. She was able to force out just one word at a time. Ms. Uphold called for help and was ushered to a waiting room while the medical team called an emergency code. Ms. Cooper grew even more distressed and “uncooperative,”  according  to medical records. Doctors re- strained her and inserted a breathing tube down her throat, violating the wishes outlined in her medical chart. \n# \n# \nMarie Cooper led her life ac- cording to her Christian faith. She baked pies for her neighbors in northern West Virginia and said grace before even a bite of food. She watched Jimmy Swaggart, a televangelist preacher   $\\mathrm{~-~a~}$   little too loudly, in her daughter Sherry Uphold’s opinion. And she always said that at the end of her life, she did not want to be resuscitated. “My mother’s religious belief is when it is her time to go, that’s God’s choosing, not hers,” Ms. Up- hold said. “She was very adamant about that.” \nEMILIANO RODRÍGUEZ MEGA MEXICO CITY — For months, tensions have been building in Mexico  over  the  president’s sweeping plans to overhaul the ju- diciary, shaking the country’s po- litical system and straining diplo- matic ties with the United States. This week, those tensions ex- ploded into the open. \nShe’d had “do not resuscitate” and “do not intubate” orders on file for decades and had just filled out new copies, instructing medical staff to withhold measures to re- start her heart if it stopped, and to never give her a breathing tube.

He skipped synagogue, but still went to the grocery store. \n“‘Pause’ means that we are go- ing to take a break,” he added, say- ing it would also extend to the U.S. State Department. But Mr. López Obrador said that overall rela- tions would not be affected, seek- ing to allay concerns over a poten- tial effect on trade. Mexico is the United States’ top trading partner, and there are growing concerns and warnings about the effect of the judicial reforms on business confidence and the economy.

Trump ran for president in 2016, there was not much love for tariffs in Washington. Many Re- publicans and Democrats be- lieved that putting levies on im- ports created economic inefficien- cies and that freer trade was the best recipe for growth. \nThat view has largely fallen out of fashion in 2024. While Mr. Trump and Vice President Kama- la Harris, the Democratic nomi- nee, differ greatly in their cam- paign proposals, both of their par- ties are increasingly embracing tariffs as an essential tool in pro- tecting American manufacturers from Chinese and other global competitors. \nIt has been a sharp reversal from previous decades, when most politicians fought to lower tariffs rather than raise them. But the loss of American manufactur- ing jobs as a result of globalization and China’s focus on churning out cheap exports have created a bi- partisan backlash against more open  trade.  Given  that  Mr. Trump’s 2016 win capitalized on such sentiments, Democrats have been striving to avoid losing vot- ers opposed to free trade. “On economic policy and trade \nissues, you have both major par- ties moving in the same direction,” said Nick Iacovella, a senior vice president at the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advo- cates tariffs and domestic invest- ments in industry. \nMr. Iacovella said that Mr. Trump would most likely go fur- ther on tariffs than Ms. Harris would, but that no matter who won the election “it’s still going to be a tariffs administration, and an industrial policy one.” \nMs. Harris has sought to differ- entiate herself from Mr. Trump’s trade proposals, which include tariffs of 10 percent to 20 percent on most imports, as well as levies of more than 60 percent on China. Many economists say that level of tariffs would drive up prices for consumers,  since  companies would be likely to pass on higher import costs. \nAt the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, Ms. Harris described the propos- als as “a national sales tax — call it a Trump tax” — and said the plans “would raise prices on middle- class families by almost \\$4,000 a year.” \nEconomists’ estimates vary, but the left-leaning Center for Ameri- can Progress Action Fund calcu- lated that the tariffs could in- crease costs on a middle-income family by \\$3,900 per year. Ms. Harris has not said much about how she would approach tariffs, including whether she would impose additional levies on China. But Charles Lutvak, a  Continued on Page A11 \n# \nAbout 1,000 miles away, in New Orleans, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has turned its corner of the federal judiciary into a proving ground for some of the most aggressive conservative ar- guments in American law. Six of the 17 judges were nominated by former  president  Donald  J. Trump, who has vowed to contin- ue transforming the federal judi- ciary with further nominations if elected again in November.

There are more people in China who are 65 or older than there are in any other country. And Shanghai has more older adults than any other Chinese city. Most of these resi- dents stopped working long ago because China has one of the low- est retirement ages in the world,  Continued on Page A5 \n# \n# \n# \n# \nThe Supreme Court term that ended this summer delivered a number of big wins for traditional conservative causes. The court made it easier to challenge federal regulations. It made it harder to prosecute former presidents. And it delivered another decision that expanded the rights of gun enthu- siasts. \nSHANGHAI — For Shanghai’s lonely and retired, love is elusive. Divorced or widowed residents gather in a dating corner in Peo- ple’s Park every weekend looking for a chat. They mill about an Ikea canteen on Tuesdays in search of some fun. \n“I’m simple. I don’t smoke ciga- rettes or play mahjong,” said Xu Xiaoduo, 70, a twice-divorced for- mer primary-school teacher who volunteers details about his pen- sion (around \\$1,250 a month) and his dancing abilities (very good). “But,” he added with a sigh, “I \nmajority that had already up- ended abortion rights and affirm- ative action, is the most ideolog- ically  conservative  Supreme Court since the early 1930s.
