Bromwich ,  Jonathan Swan , Maggie Haberman  and  William K. Rashbaum . \nMr. Trump denies any role in falsifying the records, and says he never had sex with the porn star, Stormy Daniels. His lawyers dis- pute that any crime occurred. Despite months of preparation, Mr. Cohen, 57, will be unpredict- able on the stand, prone as he is to both tirades and charm. \nDonald J. Trump has always surrounded himself with lawyers — all types of lawyers. There are the  television-friendly  talking heads. The polished criminal practitioners. The pit-bull litiga- tors, the corporate suits and the legal advisers with their own legal troubles. \nProsecutors acknowledged on Friday having little control over Mr. Cohen, who, despite their ad- monitions, has taunted Mr. Trump throughout the trial. In a recent TikTok video, Mr. Trump’s law- yers complained, he wore a shirt with a picture of the former presi- dent behind bars, prompting the judge to request that he keep qui- et. \nAnd then there was the singular Michael D. Cohen, lawyer by trade and enforcer by nature. With the loyalty of a surrogate son, he kept Mr. Trump’s secrets and cleaned up his messes. He was the fixer. This week, however, Mr. Cohen is poised to unfix Mr. Trump’s life. When he takes the stand as a vital witness at Mr. Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan, Mr. Cohen will unearth some of the secrets he buried, revealing a mess that prosecutors say his former boss was desperate to hide. \nBut prosecutors, who are offer- \nMichael D. Cohen said he had once been a “designated thug.” \nIt will represent a pivotal mo- ment of the trial, and the climax of a decades-long relationship be- tween two New York loudmouths who used each other, betrayed each other and will now face off on the biggest stage: the first crimi- nal trial of an American president. Interviews with 10 of Mr. Co- hen’s allies and adversaries, as well as a review of court records and Mr. Cohen’s books, paint a portrait of a once-obscure opera- tor who came to play an outsize role in American politics, a man whose relationship with the for- mer president traced an arc from asset to threat. \n# \n# \nweapons. And Ukrainian soldiers, by all accounts, are exhausted. More than two years of trying to fight off a country with three times the population to draw from has left Ukraine so depleted and desperate for fresh troops that its lawmakers have voted to mobilize convicts, a controversial practice that Ukraine had ridiculed Russia for using in the first half of the war. One  Ukrainian  commander took the unusual step on Sunday of blasting his colleagues for what he said were terrible border de- fenses. \nUnclear if Incursion Is Just Setback for Kyiv or a Turning Point \n# \nKHARKIV, Ukraine — In the past three days, Russian troops, backed by fighter jets, artillery and lethal drones, have poured across Ukraine’s northeastern border and seized at least nine vil- lages and settlements, and more square miles per day than at al- most any other point in the war, save the very beginning. \nThis article is by  Patrick Kingsley , Julian E. Barnes  and  Adam Rasgon . JERUSALEM — After Hamas attacked Israel in October, ignit- ing the war in Gaza, Israeli lead- ers described the group’s most senior official in the territory, Yahya Sinwar, as a “dead man walking.” Considering him an ar- chitect of the raid, Israel has por- trayed Mr. Sinwar’s assassination as a major goal of its devastating counterattack. \npeople shouted at each other and families with no place to go spilled out onto the grass. \ning Mr. Cohen nothing in return, have little leverage to rein him in. Unlike a traditional cooperating witness who trades testimony for leniency, he has already spent more than a year in federal prison for paying the hush money and committing other crimes. \nAs the sense of panic spreads, especially in Kharkiv, some hard questions loom: How far will this go? Is it just a momentary setback for the underdog Ukrainians? Or a turning point? \nFrom the stand, Mr. Cohen will tell of his greatest coup in Mr. Trump’s employ, the time when he paid  $\\bar{\\S}130{,}0\\bar{0}0$   to suppress a porn star’s story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. He did so, he will say, at his boss’s direction. And, il- luminating what prosecutors say is the cover-up at the heart of the case, he is expected to offer his firsthand account of how, after the 2016 election, the new president reimbursed him for the hush \n“The first line of fortifications and mines just didn’t exist,” Denys Yaroslavsky, a reconnaissance  Continued on Page A6 \nMilitary experts say the Rus- sian advance has put Ukraine in a very dangerous spot.

Putin has replaced his minister of defense.  PAGE A6 \nEven as Israeli officials seek his killing, they have been forced to negotiate with him, albeit indi- rectly, to free the remaining hos- tages. Mr. Sinwar has emerged not only as a strong-willed com- mander but as a shrewd negotia- tor who has staved off an Israeli battlefield victory while engaging Israeli envoys at the negotiating table, according to officials from Hamas, Israel and the United States. Some spoke on the condi- tion of anonymity to discuss sensi- tive intelligence assessments of Mr. Sinwar and diplomatic negoti- ations. \n# \n\nThis article is by  Ryan Mac ,  Jack Nicas  and  Alex Travelli . \nMinutes after it became clear that Javier Milei had been elected president of South America’s sec- ond-largest nation in November, Elon Musk posted on X: “Prosper- ity is ahead for Argentina.” Since then, Mr. Musk has con- tinued to use X, the social network he owns, to boost Mr. Milei. The billionaire has shared videos of the Argentine president attacking “social justice” with his 182 million followers. One doctored image, which implied that watching a speech by Mr. Milei was better than having sex, is among Mr. Musk’s most viewed posts ever. Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the rela- tionship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric car- maker Tesla and the rocket com- pany SpaceX. \nWhile the talks are mediated in Egypt and Qatar, it is Mr. Sinwar — believed to be hiding in a tunnel network beneath Gaza — whose consent is required by Hamas’s negotiators before they agree to any concessions, according to some of those officials. \nHamas officials insist that Mr. Sinwar does not have the final say in the group’s decisions. But though Mr. Sinwar does not tech- nically have authority over the en- tire Hamas movement, his leader- ship role in Gaza and his forceful personality have given him out- size importance in how Hamas op- erates, according to allies and foes alike. \nFrom left, the Irish wolfhounds Rowan and Brody at their hotel in Long Island City, N.Y.; Vitellozzo the French bulldog, who slept through most of his multipart journey from Croatia; and last year’s Best in Show winner, Buddy Holly, a petit basset griffon Vendéen. \n# \nSome 2,500 top-ranked dogs are in New York City to compete in this year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.
