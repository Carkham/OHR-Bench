No. 60,216  + © 2024  The New York Times Company MONDAY, JULY 15, 2024 \n\n# \n# \n# \nThe shooter in Butler, Pa., fired from a nearby rooftop on Saturday and was killed by the Secret Service.  Former President Donald J. Trump and at least three spectators were struck. One of them, a 50-year-old man, died. \n\nMr. Trump was taken to the hos- pital on Saturday night but was able to walk off his plane unaided when it landed in New Jersey hours later. On Sunday, he vowed to remain “defiant in the face of wickedness” and flew to Milwau- kee for the start of the Republican National Convention on Monday, saying he would not let the assas- sination  attempt  change  his “scheduling, or anything else.” \nThis article is by  Michael D. Shear ,  Glenn Thrush ,  Peter Baker and  Michael Levenson . \nInvestigators searched on Sun- day for a motive that would ex- plain why a 20-year-old armed with an AR-15-style semiautomat- ic rifle shot at former President Donald J. Trump, just days before he was to accept the Republican nomination for president. \nThe  assassination  attempt, which wounded Mr. Trump and killed one of his supporters, was being treated by the F.B.I. as a possible act of domestic terror- ism. And it immediately raised questions about why the Secret Service and other law enforce- ment agencies had not secured a nearby building outside the large outdoor venue where Mr. Trump held his rally. \nThe gunman, who was identi- fied by the F .B.I. as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb, was killed by the Secret Service, the agency said. Law enforcement of- ficials later found a possible rudi- mentary explosive device in his car, Paul Abbate, deputy director of the F .B.I., said. \nAn AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle found next to Mr. Crooks’s body had been bought by Mr. Crooks’s father, the F .B.I. said. It was not clear if he had given Mr. Crooks the weapon, or if Mr. Crooks had taken it without per- mission. \nThe  gunman  apparently climbed  onto  the  building’s rooftop with a rifle and fired multi- ple times, wounding Mr. Trump just minutes into his speech on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in Butler, Pa., north of Pittsburgh. Within  moments,  someone shouted “shooter down” and Se- cret Service agents, agitated but in control, began moving Mr. Trump offstage to safety. “Wait, wait, wait, wait,” he called out. He then made a point of pumping his fist at the crowd and seemed to de- fiantly shout, “Fight! Fight!” The moment — captured in photos that showed Mr. Trump’s fist held aloft, his cheek bloody, with the American flag behind him — roused Mr. Trump’s stunned sup- porters, who broke out in chants of “U.S.A.!” \nThe gunman did not have a criminal history in Pennsylvania’s public court records. A voter- registration record showed that he had registered as a Republican. Federal campaign-finance rec- ords also show he donated \\$15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a liberal  voter  turnout  group, through the Democratic donation platform ActBlue in 2021.

But the assassination attempt against former President Donald J. Trump seems more likely to tear America further apart than to bring it together. Within min- utes of the shooting, the air was filled with anger, bitterness, suspicion and recrimination. Fingers were pointed, conspiracy theories advanced and a country already bristling with animosity fractured even more. \nMr. Trump, the presumptive Re- publican nominee, was herded off the stage and pronounced fine, but the gunman came shockingly close to succeeding. A spectator was killed in the shooting and two others were critically wounded. “Congress will do a full investi- gation of the tragedy yesterday to determine where there were lapses in security and anything else that the American people need to know and deserve to know,” Speaker Mike Johnson, Re- publican of Louisiana, said Sun- day on NBC. \nBut many details of the life and motives of the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, were still un- clear. Federal authorities said the gunman had no history of mental health issues or previous threats, and had not been on the radar of federal law enforcement. \nAn annotated photograph by Doug Mills of The Times, who reflected on his experience at Donald J.

Mr. Crooks was shot and killed by Secret Service agents moments after he began firing from a rooftop outside the rally where Mr. Trump was speaking. Kevin P . Rojek, the F.B.I. official in Pittsburgh who is leading the investigation, said Mr. Crooks is believed to have acted alone and that there were no additional pub- lic safety concerns. \nMr. Biden’s directive, though brief and without specifics, is likely to increase the scrutiny of the decisions and possible failures of the agency charged first and foremost with protecting the lives of the country’s current and for- mer leaders, and their families. \nMr. Comperatore was shot in the head and died at the scene, au- thorities said. Two other rally at- tendees were critically injured in the shooting. Officials and Mr. Comperatore’s sister,  Dawn  Comperatore Schafer, confirmed his identity on Sunday. “We watched him die on the news,” she said in a phone in- terview, through tears. “That’s how we found out.” Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, said on Sunday that Mr. Comperatore “died a hero,” adding that “Corey was the very best of us.” Mr. Comperatore, of Sarver, Pa., had two daughters — Allyson, 27, and Kaylee, 24.
