Shell companies at that address have acquired millions of re- stricted chips and sensors for mili- tary technology companies in Russia, many of which have been placed under sanctions by the U.S. government, according to an ex- amination by The New York Times. \nAround 4 a.m., the arsonists cut through and burned cables used for signaling and security near three rail divides, the French au- thorities  said.  The  carefully placed strikes snarled end-of- week travel plans for more than a million people, including Pari- sians leaving for vacation and in- ternational travelers en route to the opening ceremony of the Games. Parts of the prized rail system came to a standstill. A fourth sabotage attempt was foiled, the authorities said, when railway workers doing mainte- nance work in Vergigny, southeast of Paris, stumbled upon suspi- cious individuals who fled before \nThe companies have names like Olax Finance and Rikkon Holding. Their office, with a faded 704 num- ber on the door, appears unoccu- pied. No one answered during a visit last month. An ad for air-con- ditioning hung in the crack of the door. \n# \n# \nNo one was killed or reported injured. The Paris prosecutor’s of- fice, which handles major orga- nized crime cases, said it had opened an investigation into what it called criminal vandalism and criminal conspiracy. No immedi- ate claim of responsibility was made. \nYet the companies are a crucial link in a chain connecting U.S. re- search laboratories to Chinese factories, Russian arms makers and the battlefields of Ukraine — and a sign that the U.S. govern- ment and tech giants cannot con- trol where their technology goes. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, nearly \\$4 billion of re- stricted chips have poured into Russia from more than 6,000 com- panies, including those at Hong Kong’s 135 Bonham Strand, ac- cording to a Times analysis of Russian customs data, corporate records, domain registrations and sanctions data. The analysis ex- amined nearly 800,000 shipments of restricted electronic goods into Russia since mid-2021. Even as the West sought to cut off access to semiconductors through trade restrictions, Russia established such a robust parallel supply chain that it imported al- most the same number of critical chips in the last three months of 2023 that it did in the same period in 2021, according to the analysis of Russian customs data. The reli- ance on China for many of these chips also deepened, with transac- tions that were historically settled in U.S. dollars now increasingly executed in renminbi, according to the analysis.

In their rooms at the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee, they went over each other’s speeches to the Republican National Con- vention. She gave notes on his, and he tweaked hers. In keeping with many intellec- tual and professional endeavors over the course of their relation- ship, which got its start at Yale Law School more than a decade ago, they approached the task as a couple. \n“This operation was prepared, coordinated, critical points were targeted, which shows they knew enough about the network to know where to strike,” Prime Min- ister Gabriel Attal said. \nIt sounded like a story ripped from a narco thriller: One of the biggest drug lords in Mexico was lured onto an airplane, flown across the border and presented to American federal agents by the son of his former partner in crime. As improbable as it may seem, that is exactly what appears to have happened on Thursday evening, when a Beechcraft King Air turboprop landed at a small municipal airport outside El Paso, and off stepped one of the most wanted men in Mexico: Ismael Zambada García, a founder of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel. \nMr. Zambada García, known as El Mayo, had for decades evaded capture by both Mexican and American officials, living a life of luxurious simplicity in the moun- tains of Sinaloa — despite the \\$15 million U.S. bounty on his head. But in the end, U.S. officials said, he was betrayed by an un- likely foe: a son of his closest crim- inal ally, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo, who is now serving a life sentence in an American federal  Continued on Page A6 \ndays earlier, former President Donald J.

Dr. Rand- hawa and her colleagues followed up on that observation with a more systematic study. From Oc- tober to December 2022, they reg- ularly searched for listings on eBay, Etsy and Amazon.
