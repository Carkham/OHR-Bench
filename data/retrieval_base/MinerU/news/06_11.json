But that is what Presi- dent Emmanuel Macron has done by calling a snap parlia- mentary election in France on the back of a humiliation by the far right. \nThis article is by  Farnaz Fassihi , Michael Crowley ,  Mike Ives  and Thomas Fuller . \nThe United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S.-backed cease-fire plan for the Gaza Strip with only Russia ab- staining, a sign of the growing frustration among the world’s ma- jor powers over the war and the desire to bring it to an end. \nAfter the National Rally of Marine Le Pen and her popular protégé Jordan Bardella handed him a crushing defeat on Sunday in elections for the European Parliament, Mr. Macron might have done nothing. He might also have reshuffled his govern- ment, or simply altered course through stricter controls on immigration and by renouncing contested plans to tighten rules on unemployment benefits. \nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Na- tions, told members of the Securi- ty Council that Israel had already agreed to the deal laid out in the resolution — although Israel has so far resisted taking a public po- sition on it — and she urged Ha- mas “to do the same.” \n“Hamas can now see that the in- ternational community is united, united behind a deal that will save lives and help Palestinian civil- ians in Gaza start to rebuild and heal,” she said. \n# \n# \nvoted one way on Sunday, will vote another in a few weeks. “I am astonished, like almost everyone else,” said Alain Duha- mel, the prominent author of “Emmanuel the Bold,” a book about Mr. Macron. “It’s not mad- ness, it’s not despair, but it is a huge risk from an impetuous man who prefers taking the initiative to being subjected to events.” \nThe 14-0 vote may strengthen the hand of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who returned to the Middle East on Monday to press Hamas and Israel to agree to a cease-fire. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nHELENA, Mont. — On a typical day, Ali Mullen races from her job at the county health department in Helena to pick up dinner for her three children, heads home to feed them and then goes back out for a violin lesson or a school play, crisscrossing the small city in her aging   $\\mathrm{{S.U.V.}}$  ., with a rainbow bumper sticker that reads “You Are Loved.” \nFor more than a decade, Ameri- ca’s campaign watchdog agency was a portrait of dysfunction. Di- vided equally between three Re- publicans and three Democrats, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked so often it became a political punchline as investiga- tions languished, enforcement slowed and updated guidelines for the internet era stalled. Now the commission has sud- \n# \nBut in a sign of the difficulties \n\nShock coursed through France on Monday. The stock market plunged.

Those on both sides of the ideo- logical divide agree on one thing: The changes amount to some of the most significant regulatory re- visions since the campaign fi- nance law, the McCain-Feingold Act, was put in place two decades ago. \n“It’s in the culture,” she said one afternoon in Helena. “If you don’t know someone, you know of someone who has died.” \nA big pack of gummy bears keeps her going, stashed in her handbag next to a different sort of lifesaver: a gun lock that she car- ries almost everywhere she goes. In a sparsely populated state where many people own firearms, the small metal contraptions, which fit around a trigger and cost less than \\$10 on Amazon, are one way Montanans are trying to re- duce the high rate of people who kill themselves. \nMurder rates and mass shoot- ings make national headlines, de- fining the discussion over perva- sive gun violence. But most gun deaths in America are self-in- flicted. There were about 27,000 gun suicides in 2022. That was a record, and far higher than the 19,500 gun homicides documented that year. \nIn a series of recent decisions that are remaking the landscape of money in American politics, an ascendant new bloc of three Re- publicans and one Democrat is voting together to roll back limits on how politicians, political par- ties and super PACs raise and spend money. \nRemnants of a Gaza home on Sunday after an Israeli attack. \nthe European vote, accused Mr. Macron of “a dangerous game.” France is always a mystery, its perennial discontent and restive- ness at odds with its prosperity and beauty, but this was a sur- prise of unusual proportions. Mr. Macron, after a stinging defeat in which the National Rally won 31.4 percent of the vote to 14.6 percent for the coalition led by his Renaissance party, has in effect called his country’s bluff, asking if its apparent readiness for the extreme right in power is real or a mere letting-off of steam. \n“These decisions are a monu- mental shift in the law at the com- mission,” said Sean Cooksey, the Republican chairman of the Fed- Continued on Page A13 \nfacing Mr. Blinken and other me- diators in achieving a final deal, Israel’s representative to the U.N., Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly, did not say Israel had accepted the terms of the cease-fire plan.

It is signed by someone who, for the past two years in Europe, has pur- sued anything but: President Vla- dimir V. Putin of Russia. The plaque is a replica of a letter Mr. Putin sent in 2003, nearly two decades before his invasion of Ukraine, and for years it drew lit- tle notice from Bari’s residents or the tens of thousands of pilgrims who visit the site annually to ven- erate the saint, whose remains are interred there. But a growing number of people now see it as sign of Mr. Putin’s hypocrisy — \nparticularly among a diaspora of local Ukrainians who want it tak- \nThe war will be among the most pressing issues that leaders of the world’s largest advanced econo- mies and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine will discuss this week at an annual meeting of the Group of 7, which is being hosted by Italy and held just an hour down the road. For the many residents of Bari who have wanted the plaque removed since the war began, the gathering nearby is seen as a chance to en- list Mr. Putin’s fiercest interna- tional critics to their cause. “Since Putin has been declared an international criminal, to have  \n# \nwomen who worked there grew fond of the diffident man who asked permission to escape the sun.

Its rise reflects the aging of the un- housed population and the dec- ade-long expansion of Medicaid, which helps cover the cost. Many programs also get subsidies from hospitals or insurance companies eager to shorten hospital stays or  Continued on Page A16 \n# \n# \nPHOENIX — Five years on the Phoenix streets battered Vance Blair’s body.
