Speaking to the BBC, Mr. Zelensky said he had a plan to end the “hot stage” of the war this year. He dispatched his foreign minister on a surprise trip to China, a mission to im- prove Ukraine’s relationship with Russia’s most important partner. And he pushed for a series of international meetings, including \nHarris does not have a policy page on her campaign website. \nA last-minute campaign born of Mr. Biden’s depreciated political standing has so far been running mainly on Democratic good feel- ings and warmth toward Ms. Har- ris, drafting off legislation and proposed policies from the man she is hoping to succeed. \nDemocrats’ problem for most of this year appeared to be Mr. Biden himself, rather than his policies. For more than a year, as his poll numbers sank, his aides and loy- alists insisted that his legislative record and priorities were viewed favorably by Americans and would ultimately carry him to an- other term. \none planned for Qatar this month, in which he hoped to rally backing for Ukraine’s positions and pave the way for a broader settlement. His summer overtures de- parted from the two years of Mr. Zelensky’s refusing to offer any hint of concessions in the face of a Russian invasion that many Ukrainians believe aims to wipe their country off the map. And they made it all the more stun- ning when on Aug. 6, Ukrainian forces rolled into Russia’s Kursk region, delivering one of the most embarrassing moments for President Vladimir V . Putin of Russia in 30 months of war and confounding predictions that the two countries might be headed toward a cease-fire. Kyiv is making a risky bet: that the incursion gives it new leverage for a favorable deal with the Kremlin, even as its military remains on the defense across much of the front line in Ukraine. Russians who know Mr. Putin expect him to lash out in response, believing that his military has the upper hand in personnel and weaponry. There are already signs that cease-fire efforts suffered a setback. A diplomat involved in the talks said that Russian offi- cials postponed a meeting planned to be held in Qatar this month to negotiate a deal in which both sides would stop attacks on the other’s energy infrastructure. The postpone- ment was reported earlier by The Washington Post. In comments reported on Monday by Russian state media, Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said, “At the cur- rent stage, given this escapade, we are not going to talk.” The length of any pause in negotia- tions, Mr. Ushakov added, “de- pends on the situation, including on the battlefield.” Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a long- time Russian politician who met with Mr. Putin last October to promote the idea of a cease-fire, said in an interview from Mos- cow that there had been hope in the Russian capital that “the fighting would stop this year.” “The circumstances that have just happened,” he added, “they have lowered all these chances, they have removed them from  \n# \nEnergized party members filled Chicago’s United Center on Monday on Day 1 of their national convention.

The Clintons rushed out an endorsement well ahead of many other party leaders, includ- ing the Obamas. As Democrats revolted against Mr. Biden’s re-election bid this summer, Mrs. Clinton wanted no role in pushing him out, according to people briefed on her thinking. But behind the scenes, she was also adamant that if the president chose to step aside, Ms. Harris should become the party’s nomi- nee with no drawn out primary. The two women, once on oppo- site sides during the contentious 2008 Democratic primary, have quietly bonded over the past sev- \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — Hillary Clin- ton was on Martha’s Vineyard on Sunday, July 21, the day President Biden dropped out of the presi- dential race, when her phone rang. Her husband, former Presi- dent Bill Clinton, had already re- ceived a call from the same num- ber, so she knew who wanted to talk to her. \nThe last time Mrs. Clinton stood on the convention stage, dressed in suffragist white, she thought she was on track to be the next president. Much has happened since then — from Mrs. Clinton’s grief over and eventual accept- ance of her 2016 loss, to the rise of a new generation of Democratic leaders.

In contrast to the conven- tional medical advice that parents spoon-feed babies special infant cereals and purées, parents in- stead offer their babies solid food that they feed to themselves, usu- ally at around 6 months old. To the uninitiated, baby-led weaning can seem shocking and scary: You’re really just going to hand an infant with no teeth a whole chicken drumstick? But proponents insist it is not only safe when done properly but also promotes oral- and motor-skill de- velopment and a healthier, happi- \nIn baby-led weaning, children feed themselves solid food. \n# \nJenny Best was determined that her firstborn son would have a positive relationship with food from his very first bite. Years ear- lier, as a professional ballerina, she had struggled with disordered eating, and she wanted her son to think of food as fun. \n“I made the homemade purées, and I got the expensive little baby blender, and I tried to concoct these things from scratch, and then, from Day 1, he didn’t like it,” Ms. Best said, wincing at the eight-year-old memory. “He was crying and arching his back, and turning his head, and particularly did not like me coming at him, at his face, with a spoon.” Ms. Best’s son stopped eating altogether by his first birthday, and his weight dropped so precipi- tously that a doctor recommended a feeding tube.

He was 88. His death was confirmed by Su- \nTV in Dayton, Ohio, propelling him on a 29-year syndicated run, much of it as the unchallenged king of daytime talk television. Almost from the start, the show dispensed with familiar trap- pings. There was no opening monologue, no couch, no sidekick, no band — just the host and the guests, focused on a single topic.
