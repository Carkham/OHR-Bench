No. 60,229 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nThe Secret Service, which looks after 36 protectees and foreign leaders, waiting for President Biden in Las Vegas this month. \n# \nOn Its No-Fail Mission, the Agency Faces Fatigue, Scrutiny and Low Morale \n# \nOver the years, whenever the United States Secret Service’s lack of resources has been an is- sue, agents invoke a tongue-in- cheek motto: We do more with less. \nmay need to request additional re- sources to bolster our protective mission,” a spokesman for the Se- cret Service said in a statement to The New York Times. \nThe agency has come under scrutiny for having turned down some requests for additional fed- eral security assets for Mr. Trump’s detail, though the agency says that was not the case on July 13. The agency says it routinely uses local law enforcement offi- cers to supplement its protective forces. While the agency has said about 100 law enforcement offi- cers were present in Butler, it has not said how many of them were active Secret Service employees. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said on social media that he would contin- \nInterviews with current and former Secret Service agents re- veal an agency that wears down its employees, risking their sharp- ness. And they portray an organi- zation that spends so much money on physical protection that there are few funds left to stay abreast of the latest law enforcement training and technologies. \nAn assassination attempt on former  President  Donald  J. Trump at a campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pa., has exposed weaknesses in the Secret Serv- ice’s make-do approach to securi- ty for the country’s highest elected officials, their families and visiting foreign leaders. \nThe Secret Service currently looks after 36 protectees, down from 42 during Mr. Trump’s presi- dency. This year, the service, which employs more than 8,000 people, received \\$3.1 billion in con- gressional funding. \nKimberly A. Cheatle, before she resigned as Secret Service direc- tor, told a congressional commit- tee on Monday that the shooting — which left the former presi- dent’s ear bloodied and injured three other spectators, one fatally — “is the most significant opera- tional failure at the Secret Service in decades.” \nBy comparison, the U.S. Mar- shals Service, whose 5,600 em- ployees protect federal judges and courts and transport prisoners,  Continued on Page 18 \n# \n# \npart of a close-knit group of 16 stu- dents who remained together throughout their first law school semester in the fall of 2010. As now-Senator Vance seeks the vice presidency, Nelson has shared about 90 of their emails and text messages, primarily from 2014 through 2017, with The New York Times. \n# \n# \n\nWhen his book, “Hillbilly Ele- gy,” was published in 2016, JD Vance sent an email apologizing to a close friend from his Yale Law School days. The friend identified as transgender, but Mr. Vance re- ferred to them in the book as a les- bian. \nThe agency’s security lapses in Butler have spurred numerous in- vestigations and prompted debate as to whether the Secret Service, which is operating with its largest- ever budget, has adequate re- sources to fulfill its critical man- date and is using its funds in the most effective manner. So far this year, according to an agency offi- cial, the Secret Service has se- cured more than 7,500 sites, in- cluding the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. “The Secret Service is conduct- \nBut as They Raise Funds, She Keeps Distance \nreally sorry,” he wrote. “I hope you’re not offended, but if you are, I’m sorry! Love you, JD.” Nelson wrote back the same day, calling Mr. Vance “buddy” and thanking him for “being sweet,” adding, “If you had writ- ten gender queer radical pragma- tist, nobody would know what you mean.” Nelson asked for an auto- graphed copy, then signed off with, “Love, Sofia.” \n# \nThe emails, in which Mr. Vance criticizes former President Don- ald J. Trump both for “racism” and as a “morally reprehensible hu- man being,” add to an already-ex- isting body of evidence showing Mr. Vance’s ideological pivot from Never Trumper to Mr. Trump’s running mate. \n“Hey Sofes, here’s an excerpt from my book,” Mr. Vance wrote to his friend, Sofia Nelson. “I send this to you not just to brag, but be- cause I’m sure if you read it you’ll notice reference to ‘an extremely progressive lesbian.’” \nWASHINGTON — Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris has forsworn direct donations from lobbyists, but they are welcoming her candi- dacy and finding other ways to support it. \nIn the days since President Bi- den dropped his re-election cam- paign and Ms. Harris moved swiftly to lock up the Democratic Party’s nomination, Washington’s influence industry has quietly jockeyed to position itself with her team. \nKimberly A.

Some lobbying firms have highlighted their connections to Ms. Harris, drawing the ire of allies seeking to avoid the perception that she is beholden to special interests. \n# \n# \nLOS ANGELES — For nearly two decades, Hollywood has seemingly missed no opportunity to sound the alarm about climate change. \nJENIN, West Bank — Less than three years ago, Wassif Fra- hat spent \\$3 million to open a lav- ish, two-story restaurant, the Ali Baba. With an impressive, pil- lared entryway, polished stone floors, glittering chandeliers and colorful frescoes on the high ceil- ings, the restaurant was his com- mitment to a better future. \nThere have been cri de coeur documentaries, most notably “An Inconvenient Truth.” Superheroes have been concerned, with Bat- man bemoaning mankind’s treat- ment of the planet in “Justice League.” Nary an award show goes by without a star or several begging viewers to take envi- ronment-saving action. \n“Human nature is such that anybody that ever walked past somebody on the street would try to capitalize,” said former Senator Doug Jones, an Alabama Demo- crat who is close to Ms. Harris. “Especially in a campaign for president, there is always going to be those folks.” \nThe Ali Baba, in Jenin, is just a few minutes’ drive from the Jalameh checkpoint, which in nor- mal times allows Israeli Arab citi- zens entry to the West Bank. The atmosphere is Palestinian, and the shops, restaurants and serv- ices are significantly cheaper than in Israel. The crossing also allows Palestinians with valid entry per- mits to go to jobs in Israel. But after Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, the check- point was closed. Israel withheld most tax revenue from the au- thorities in the West Bank, in an effort to weaken them and clamp down more broadly on Palestin- ians. The economy in the territo- ry’s north collapsed, and the bet- ter future that Mr. Frahat ex- pected now seems farther away than ever. The war that followed the inva- \nSo it was startling when the weather-focused “Twisters” ar- rived from Universal Pictures this month with no mention of climate change at all. If ever there was a perfect vehicle to carry Holly- wood’s  progressive  climate change messaging — a big-budget movie about people caught in worsening storm patterns — was- n’t this it? \nMr. Jones — a government rela- tions adviser, but not a registered lobbyist, at the law and lobbying firm ArentFox Schiff — said he was planning a Washington fund- raising event for Ms. Harris’s campaign featuring lawyers from a host of firms. \nSimone Biles, training in Paris for her third Games, has a record 37 Olympic and world medals. \n# \nInstead of just frowning or shaking her head in frustration, which would have been the norm, because the judges were watch- ing, Biles — who ended up win- ning the meet — let out an exple- tive. \nthe competition floor. \nApparently not. Movies should not be about “preaching a mes- sage,” Lee Isaac Chung, who di- rected “Twisters,” said in a prere- lease interview that served as a dog whistle to conservative ticket buyers. \nAt 27, she is the best gymnast in history, by natural talent and also medal count, having transformed the sport with dangerously diffi- cult routines that remain un- matched. For years, she sacrificed both mind and body for gymnas- tics, competing under psychologi- cal torment as a sexual assault survivor and with physical pain that made her feel as if she would need a wheelchair by the time she turned 30. \n# \nThe dramatic reset of the presi- dential race has intensified a Washington tradition, as lobbyists and other government affairs pro- fessionals rush to signal connec- tions to the candidates. \nWith a toe-tapping Beyoncé song blasting in the arena, Simone Biles leaped up to the balance beam and wobbled, leaning over and circling her arms like wind- mills as if she were trying not to fall off a cliff. \nExecuted deftly, this can create demand among prospective cli- \nTrend spotting in cinema is a hazardous pursuit.
