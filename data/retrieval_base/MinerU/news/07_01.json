No. 60,202 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nMONDAY, JULY 1, 2024 \n# \n\nObscure Authority Is Quietly Used to Block Several Dozen Trials in Just a Year \n# \nBrianna Villafane was in Lower Manhattan protesting police vio- lence in the summer of 2020, when officers charged into the crowd. One of them gripped her hair and yanked her to the ground. \nAs is typical across the United States, New York’s police commis- sioner has the final say over offi- cer discipline. Commissioners can and often do overrule civilian oversight boards. But Mr. Caban’s actions stand out for ending cases before the public disciplinary process plays out. \n“I felt someone on top of me and it was hard to breathe,” she said. “I felt like I was being crushed.” The New York City civilian oversight agency that examines allegations of police abuse investi- gated and concluded that the offi- cer had engaged in such serious misconduct that it could consti- tute a crime. \n“What the Police Department is doing here is shutting down cases under the cloak of darkness,” said Florence L. Finkle, a former head of the C.C.R.B. and current vice president of the National Associa- tion for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement.  Avoiding  disci- plinary trials “means there’s no opportunity for transparency, no opportunity for the public to weigh in, because nobody knows what’s happening.” \nMs. Villafane received a letter from the oversight agency about its conclusions. “I was happy and I was relieved,” she recalled. The next step would be a disciplinary trial overseen by the New York Police Department, during which prosecutors from the oversight agency would present evidence and question the officer in a public forum. \nIndeed, the department does not publish the commissioner’s decisions to retain cases, and the civilian oversight agency makes those details public only months after the fact. Civilians are not told that the Police Department ended their cases. \nA Celebration in Every Color The New York City Pride March, the largest of its kind in the country, attracted tens of thousands of paraders on Sunday. Page A15. \nExercising a little-known au- thority called “retention,” the commissioner, Edward Caban, en- sured the case would never go to trial. \n# \nTo piece together Commis- sioner Caban’s actions, ProPubli- ca obtained internal records of some cases and learned details of others using public records, law- suits, social media accounts and other sources. \ncorded by voters to the snap elec- tion.

He decided that it “would be detrimental to the Police Depart- ment’s disciplinary process” to pursue administrative charges \n# \n# \nPARIS — The National Rally party on Sunday won a crushing victory in the first round of voting for the French National Assembly, according to early projections, bringing its long-taboo brand of nationalist and anti-immigrant politics to the threshold of power for the first time. \nHints at Drastic Shift \nRetention has been the commis- sioner’s chief method of interven- tion. He has prevented the cases of 54 officers from going to trial in his roughly one year in office — far more than any other commis- sioner, according to an analysis of C.C.R.B. data. His predecessor,  Continued on Page A16 \nport among young people, accord- ing to the projections. Turnout was high at about 67 percent, compared with 47.5 per- cent in the first round of the last parliamentary election, in 2022, reflecting the importance ac- \ning, a letter the department sent to the oversight agency said. The force that the officer used against Ms. Villafane was “reasonable and necessary.” The commis- sioner ordered no discipline. Today, Officer Dowling is a dep- uty chief of the unit that handles protests throughout the city. His case is one of dozens in which Commissioner Caban has used the powers of his office to in- tervene in disciplinary cases against officers who were found by the oversight agency to have committed misconduct. Since becoming commissioner last July, he has short-circuited cases involving officers accused of wantonly using chokeholds, de- ploying Tasers and beating pro- testers with batons.

ChatGPT, the company said, was learning how to hear, see and converse in a naturalistic voice — one that sounded much like the disembodied operating system voiced by Scarlett Jo- hansson in the 2013 Spike Jonze movie “Her.” \nThe 48 hours after the debate were a frenzied campaign within a campaign to save Mr. Biden’s sud- denly teetering candidacy, a mul- tiday damage-control effort to pressure and plead with anxious Democratic lawmakers, surro- gates, activists and donors to stand by the president, the party’s presumptive nominee. \nThis article is by  Lisa Lerer ,  Shane Goldmacher  and  Katie Rogers . \nIn the wee hours of Friday morning, not long after President Biden had walked off the stage from a disastrous debate, his cam- paign chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, acknowledged in a series of pri- vate calls with prominent sup- porters that the night had gone poorly but urged them not to over- react. \nChatGPT’s voice, called Sky, also had a husky timbre, a sooth- ing affect and a sexy edge. She was agreeable and self-effacing; she sounded like she was game for anything. After Sky’s debut, Johansson expressed displeasure at the “eerily similar” sound, and said that she had previously declined OpenAI’s request that she voice the bot. The company protested that Sky was voiced by a “different professional actress,” but agreed to pause her voice in deference to Johansson. Bereft OpenAI users have started a petition to bring her back. \nAfter a frenetic run of seven campaign events across four states since the debate, Mr. Biden himself is taking a pause for a pre- planned family gathering at Camp David. He arrived late on Satur- day and will be joined by his wife, Jill Biden, the first lady, as well as the Biden children and grandchil- dren, according to two people fa- miliar with the scheduling. \nLater on Friday, top White House aides worked the phones, with Mr. Biden’s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, calling the Democratic leader of the Senate, Chuck Schu- mer, to check in, according to a person familiar with the call. And by the afternoon, the Biden cam- paign had transformed its weekly all-staff call into a virtual pep talk to dispel any doubts creeping into the campaign offices in Wilming- ton, Del., and beyond. \n# \nthan girls, studies have found. “I definitely think children born then have had developmental challenges compared to prior years,” said Dr. Jaime Peterson, a pediatrician at Oregon Health and Science University, whose re- search is on kindergarten readi- ness. “We asked them to wear masks, not see adults, not play with kids.
