Members of Congress and senior officials in the Biden administra- tion have fretted privately and publicly about the extent of Mr. Musk’s power as the U.S. govern- ment  increasingly  relies  on SpaceX for commercial space op- erations and for its plans to travel to the moon and even Mars. \nThis article is by  Luke Broadwa- ter ,  Robert Jimison and  Annie Karni . \nTwo hours later, once conditions were deemed safe, a team from SpaceX, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a conservation group began canvassing the fragile mi- gratory bird habitat surrounding the launch site. \nPresident Biden’s base of sup- port among key Democrats on Capitol Hill began to crumble on Sunday as a half-dozen top mem- bers of the House privately told colleagues he should withdraw from the presidential race amid growing concerns about his age and ability to win re-election. \nThe launch had unleashed an enormous burst of mud, stones and fiery debris across the public lands encircling Mr. Musk’s \\$3 bil- lion space compound. Chunks of sheet metal and insulation were strewed across the sand flats on one side of a state park. Else- where, a small fire had ignited, leaving a charred patch of park grasslands — remnants from the blastoff that burned 7.5 million pounds of fuel. \nAn examination of Mr. Musk’s tactics in South Texas shows how he exploited the limitations and competing missions of the various agencies most poised to be a check on the ferocious expansion of the industrial complex he calls Starbase. Those charged with pro- tecting the area’s cultural and nat- ural resources — particularly offi- cials from the Interior Depart- ment’s Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service — repeatedly lost out to more power- ful agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, whose goals are intertwined with Mr. Musk’s. \nDuring a virtual private meet- ing, the House Democrats — all senior members of powerful com- mittees — discussed how to use their collective influence to con- vince Mr. Biden he had little chance of defeating former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump, according to five people familiar with the confidential discussion, including three who were present, all of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss it. \nMost disturbing to one member of the entourage was the yellow smear on the soil in the same spot that a bird’s nest lay the day be- fore. None of the nine nests re- corded by the nonprofit Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program before the launch had survived in- tact. \nThe consensus during the ses- sion, which was convened by Rep- resentative  Hakeem  Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the mi- nority leader, was that a change at the top of the ticket was needed to preserve the party’s chances of holding the White House and pre- vailing in the fight for control of Congress, the people said. \nConservationists fear SpaceX operations are damaging the surrounding Boca Chica, Texas, region.

Executives from SpaceX de- clined repeated requests in per- son and via email to comment. But Gary Henry, who until this year served as a SpaceX adviser on Pentagon launch programs, said the company was aware of the of- ficials’ complaints about envi- ronmental impact and was com- mitted to addressing them. Kelvin B. Coleman, the top \n# \n“The nests have all been messed up or have eggs missing,” Justin LeClaire, a Coastal Bend wildlife biologist, told a Fish and Wildlife inspector as a New York Times reporter observed nearby. The outcome was part of a well- documented pattern. \nThe centrist Renaissance party of President Emmanuel Macron, who cast the country into turmoil a month ago by calling the elec- tion, was in second place with be- tween 150 and 174 seats, the pro- jections indicated. Trailing them was the National Rally, which took between 113 and 152 seats. \nAmong those saying explicitly that Mr. Biden should end his can- didacy were Representatives Jer- rold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Com- mittee; Adam Smith of Washing- ton, the ranking member of the Armed  Services  Committee; Mark Takano of California, the  Continued on Page A15 \nMacron’s Party at No. 2 — Far Right Loses Projected Lead \n# \nPARIS — France faced a hung parliament and deep political un- certainty after the three main po- litical groups of the left, center and right emerged from snap legisla- tive elections on Sunday with large shares of the vote but noth- ing approaching an absolute ma- jority. \nF .A.A. official overseeing space launch licenses, said he was con- vinced that his agency was doing its duty, which is to foster space travel safely. \nOn at least 19 occasions since 2019, SpaceX operations have caused fires, leaks, explosions or other problems associated with the rapid growth of Mr. Musk’s complex in Boca Chica. These in- cidents have caused environmen- tal damage and reflect a broader debate over how to balance tech- \nPen’s anti-immigrant party that dominated the first round of vot- ing a week ago.

So Mr. Medina, 30, got rid of the serrano peppers, leaving just to- matoes,  onions  and  cilantro. While he still offers an avocado salsa with serrano and a red salsa with morita chiles and chiles de árbol, he wanted to provide a non- spicy option for international vis- itors unaccustomed to intense heat. \nPrimarily calling for a cease- fire deal with Hamas that would see hostages return from captiv- ity and for new elections in Israel, protesters brought traffic to a standstill at several major inter- sections in cities and on highways across the country. Much of cen- tral Tel Aviv was blocked in one of the biggest protests in months. Some progress has been made in recent days for a resumption of negotiations toward a tentative deal after weeks of an impasse, even as the fighting continues in Gaza, where an Israeli strike hit in the area of a U.N. school on Satur- day, and across Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. \n“If you lower the heat on a salsa,” one Mexico City resi- dent said, “now it’s a dressing.” \ntion and a new home for interna- tional transplants who can work remotely and whose earnings in dollars or euros makes the city more affordable.
