She believes in crafting clear rules and in step- by-step change that can add up to durable transformation in Ameri- can society. \nThis article is by  Lisa Lerer ,  Erica L. Green  and  Zolan Kanno-Youngs . In 2005, one year into her job as San Francisco district attorney, Kamala Harris was showing a new hire around the office. \nNow, after preparing to for- mally accept the Democratic nomination on Thursday night, what Ms. Harris may be offering the nation is a future defined by the fine print, focused on accom- plishing what can be done now rather than on what could be. “She’s like, ‘What can we get done in the shortest amount of time for people?’” said Rohini Kosoglu, a former policy director who was a chief of staff to Ms. Har- ris in the Senate and who left the vice president’s office in 2022. “She’s super pragmatic.” \nMs. Harris had recruited La- teefah Simon, a 28-year-old racial justice activist, to lead a new pro- gram aimed at keeping first-time drug offenders out of jail. As the two women walked the halls, they stopped in front of a wall lined with photographs of Ms. Harris’s predecessors — all of them white men. \n“The expectation of our com- munity is that I’m going to fix all the havoc,” Ms. Harris said, ac- cording to Ms. Simon’s recollec- tion. “They’re going to want me to fix all the racism, all the dysfunc- tion, in the next four years.” But in reality, Ms. Harris said, change will happen “bit by bit.” The comment underscored the political  philosophy  that  has guided Ms. Harris’s style of gov- ernance for decades. It is among the more striking contradictions of Ms. Harris’s candidacy: While she would bring about historic change if elected, as the first wom- an, the first Asian American and the second Black person to hold the office, she is not offering sweeping change in policy. She is at heart an institutionalist, de- fined by a deliberate style, fo- cused on granular impacts over broad society shifts. \nA biracial female prosecutor from California, Ms. Harris has defied easy ideological characteri- zation — a trait that has been both her biggest political strength and, at times, her greatest liability. Her supporters see in her a me- ticulous law enforcement officer, with a style of intense preparation forged during her early years as a prosecutor, first as district attor- ney and later as California attor- ney general. Critics have called her a shape-shifter and a flip-flop- per who changes her positions based on what’s politically con- Continued on Page A12 \nONLINE  More coverage of the Democratic National Conven- tion, including Kamala Harris’s speech, at nytimes.com. \n# \nIt’s an approach that diverges from those of previous leaders who have captured the imagina- tions of the Democratic Party. President  Barack  Obama presented Americans with a hope- ful vision that promised to heal some of the nation’s deepest ra- cial, geographic and partisan di- vides. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont electrified Democrats with his populist calls for structur- al change and major economic re- form. And President Biden prom- ised to “restore the soul” of a na- tion fractured by the chaos of his predecessor’s administration. \ncago for the Democratic National Convention, under a new title. No longer labeled a journalist, Ms. Brey was now a “content creator” — better known as an influencer — and it proved to be a sizable up- grade. \nThree of them interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has not sat for a mainstream me- dia interview since becoming her party’s nominee for president. The two experiences were “wildly different,” noted Ms. Brey as she stood in a special box made for influencers on the convention floor on Tuesday night. The treatment was part of an elaborate  and  unprecedented campaign to flood social media with positive messages about Ms.  \n# \n# \nLast month, Kristin Brey, a pod- caster, radio host and newspaper columnist, attended the Republi- can National Convention in Mil- waukee as a credentialed journal- ist.

Some of the influencers, although not Ms. Brey, received free airfare and hotel rooms. \nShe and other creators got face time with Gwen Walz, the wife of the Minnesota governor Tim Walz, aboard a private boat on Lake Michigan; they were treated to tiki bar parties and catered rooftop luncheons; they had ex- clusive access to two private \nThis week, she traveled to Chi- \n# \n# \nAt the funeral of Iryna Tsybukh, who died on May 29, mourners wore traditional vyshyvankas. \nBy EMMA BUBOLA and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED \n# \n# \nThe Food and Drug Administra- tion on Thursday approved the latest slate of annual Covid vac- cines, clearing the way for Ameri- cans 6 months and older to receive updated shots in the midst of a prolonged summer surge of the vi- rus. \nPORTICELLO, Italy — Two months after being cleared in a bruising legal battle over fraud charges, the British tech mogul Mike Lynch celebrated his free- dom with a cruise. He invited his family, friends and part of his legal team on board his luxury sailing yacht, a majestic 180-foot vessel named Bayesian after the mathe- matical theorem around which he had built his empire. \nFor almost 20 years, a group of parrots and their owner lived at the Rutherford, a co-op apartment building in the ritzy Gramercy Park neighborhood of Manhattan. For almost as many years, the neighbors complained. The par- rots shrieked and squawked, they said. The parrots shouted human words, but not clearly enough for the neighbors to follow their con- versations. The parrots seemed to generally drive everyone mad. After years of complaints, the chorus of caws and cries became unbearable. So the building’s co- op board moved to evict the wom- an who cared for the animals, Meril Lesser. \nPfizer and Moderna, the vac- cine makers, are expected to be- gin shipping vaccines to pharma- cies and doctors’ offices within days. The shots are tailored to a version of the virus that took off this spring before giving way to closely related variants, all of which appear to spread faster. For the frailest Americans, who have been dying of Covid in grow- ing numbers this summer, the shots could offer a reprieve from a virus that disproportionately en- dangers those whose vaccina- tions are out of date. \nOn Sunday night, after a tour of the Gulf of Naples, including Ca- pri, and volcanic islands in the Eo- lian archipelago, the boat an- chored half a mile off the Sicilian coast in Porticello, Italy. It chose a stretch of water favored by the Phoenicians thousands of years ago for its protection from the mis- tral wind and, in more recent times, by the yachts of tech billion- aires. The boat was lit “like a Christmas tree,” local residents said, standing out against the full moon. \nIn response, Ms. Lesser said her parrots — three birds named Ginger, Layla and Curtis — were emotional support animals who also cared for her. \n# \nto a friend outlining her wishes for her funeral if she was killed on the front line. Soldiers could come in army fatigues. And everybody should learn 10 “meaningful” Ukrainian songs to sing around her coffin. \nThat set off a bitter and compli- cated legal dispute that ended last week when the federal govern- ment announced a settlement that it said imposed the largest ever fi- nancial penalty on a building that had denied its residents’ rights to service animals. \nBut the approval is occurring months after wily new variants began driving up infections, a matter of consternation for some scientists who have urged faster turnarounds for updated shots. In recent weeks, people have been hospitalized with Covid at a rate nearly twice as high as during \nneral won’t be in vain.” Her request proved to be prescient. Ms. Tsybukh was killed on May 29 on the front line near the city of Kharkiv, in northeast- ern Ukraine, days before her 26th birthday.
