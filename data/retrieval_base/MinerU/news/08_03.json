He had been jailed in Germany since 2019 for the mur- der of a Chechen former separat- ist fighter in a park in Berlin. He was the prize most sought by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who had publicly praised the killing as an act of patriotism and for years had insisted that Mr. Krasikov be part of any swap. The stunning deal took place \nThe Americans floated a pro- posal: an exchange of two dozen prisoners sitting in jails in Russia, the United States and scattered across Europe, a far bigger and more complex deal than either side had previously contemplated but one that would give both Mos- cow and Western nations more reasons to say yes. \nagainst the geopolitical backdrop of the war in Ukraine, where the United States is sending weapons to the battlefront aimed at killing as many Russian troops as possi- ble. \nQuiet negotiations between the United States and Russia over a possible  prisoner  swap  had dragged on for more than a year. They were punctuated by only oc- casional glimpses of hope for the families of the American pris- oners — including Evan Gershko- vich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, and Paul Whelan, an American security contractor — growing increasingly impatient for their ordeal to end. Those hopes were always dashed when one of the two sides balked. But the June meeting changed things, according to accounts from American and Western offi- cials and other people familiar with the long process of bringing the deal to fruition. \nAnd it reached its conclusion even as President Biden, who got personally involved in the negoti- ations at key points, was losing hope of continuing his re-election bid following a disastrous tele- vised debate that took place two days after the C.I.A. gave the Rus- sians what proved to be the deci- sive new offer. \n# \n# \nOn the morning of Sunday, July 21, Mr. Biden, sick with Covid, placed a call from his vacation home in Delaware to Slovenia’s prime minister to nail down one of the last pieces of the prisoner agreement.

It was there to chauf- feur her to the Swiss Alps, where she and her colleagues would stay at the Tivoli Lodge, a seven-bed- room chalet that cost nearly half a million dollars to rent for the week. \nThe Russian spies took the pro- posal back to Moscow, and only days later the C.I.A. director was on the phone with a Russian spy chief agreeing to the broad pa- rameters of a massive prisoner swap. On Thursday, seven differ- ent planes touched down in Anka- ra, Turkey, and exchanged pas- sengers, bringing to a successful close an intensive diplomatic ef- fort that took place almost en- tirely out of public view.

The Har- ris campaign has suggested it will announce the decision by Tuesday evening, when the vice president and her to-be-named running mate begin a five-day tour of pres- idential battleground states, start- ing in Philadelphia. \n# \n# \nPARIS — As his nation’s lone athlete at the Paris Olympics, Winzar Kakiouea carries an addi- tional burden: Most people have no idea that his country is a coun- try. \nFederal Reserve officials held off on cutting interest rates this week because they wanted to see slightly more data to feel confi- dent that inflation is truly coming under control. While that ap- proach is cautious when it comes to price increases, Friday’s em- ployment report underscored that it might be a risky one when it comes to the job market. \nAlso, his homeland could one day disappear into the ocean. First, a brief geography primer: Nauru, with a population of less than 13,000, is an island nation perched in the middle of the Pa- cific Ocean. Once known as Pleas- ant Island, Nauru (pronounced NO-roo, not Nah-oo-roo) gained its independence in 1968, after a period of trusteeship by the United Nations. Its economy for decades depended on guano, or bird poop, a key ingredient in fer- tilizer. Mining destroyed parts of the island; chunks of Nauru slid into the sea. Climate change is nibbling at its shores, too. \nSeveral of the contenders, in- cluding Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, canceled events this weekend, reflecting both a desire to be available for those conversa- tions and to avoid drawing addi- tional speculation from the news \nUnemployment rose to 4.3 per- cent in July, up from 4.1 percent previously,  as  hiring  slowed sharply. The labor market cracks have given sudden urgency to concerns that the Fed has waited too long to begin cutting rates — and that it might be falling behind, allowing the job market to slow in a way that will be hard to stall or reverse. \nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential de- cisions of Ms. Harris’s political ca- reer, one that can pay dividends in votes and years of counsel or backfire disastrously. In some ways, Ms. Harris is setting a direc- tion for the future of the party, a reality she intimately under- stands given her own head-spin- ning ascension to the top of the ticket. \n“They are absolutely behind the curve, and they need to catch up,” said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \n# \n“Most people don’t know about Nauru,” Kakiouea said. “When I tell them about it, they are shocked that this little, tiny place is a country.” \n# \nHigh Fed interest rates help to cool inflation by slowing demand. When it costs more to borrow to buy a house or expand a business, people make fewer big purchases and companies hire fewer work- ers. As economic activity pulls back, businesses struggle to raise prices as quickly, and inflation moderates. \nAt the same time, Olympic offi- cials were working urgently to re- but what they described as wide- spread  “misinformation”  — spurred by a 46-second fight on Thursday — that led some to question the presence of Lin and another boxer, Imane Khelif of Al- geria, in the Paris Games a year after they were disqualified from the world championships in a dis- pute about their eligibility.
