Gérard Tsatselam, beside the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is dealing with the fallout from accusations against a predecessor. \nOnline Following That Badly Trails Trump’s \n# \nFederal Overreach Seen Against Rapid-Fire Bump Stocks \n# \nOn a Friday afternoon in late April, President Biden brought ce- lebrities and elite social media in- fluencers together for a White House reception. Fran Drescher and David Cross mingled with Ilona Maher, a rugby star, and V from @under the desk news, at a mixer meant to generate warm feelings and badly needed pro-Bi- den content. \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court on Friday struck down a ban on bump stocks, which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire at speeds rivaling those of ma- chine guns, erasing one of the gov- ernment’s rare firearm regula- tions to result from a mass shoot- ing. \nJonathan M. Katz, an independ- ent journalist and sharp critic of the administration, was shocked to get an invitation. When he met Mr. Biden, he pointedly asked about military aid to Israel and suggested he was supporting a “genocide.” Mr. Biden answered politely, but then appeared to grow impatient. “I know you’re a typical press guy,” he said. “I trust you as far as I can throw your phone.” Aides then ushered Mr. Katz away. \nThe decision, by a vote of 6 to 3, split along ideological lines. Jus- tice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had exceeded its power when it prohibited the de- vice by issuing a rule that classi- fied bump stocks as machine guns. \nThe episode, which Mr. Katz re- corded on video and shared with his roughly 100,000 followers, was one in a series of Mr. Biden’s awk- ward attempts to manufacture on- line enthusiasm for his candidacy. For months, the president’s campaign has watched as its rival, Donald J. Trump, has surfed on his popularity among the very online. Mr. Trump’s supporters produce an endless stream of memes, vid- eos and adoring posts — all essen- tially free advertising — that \nrifle equipped with a bump stock is not a ‘machine gun’ because it cannot fire more than one shot ‘by a single function of the trigger,’” Justice Thomas wrote. His opin- ion included several diagrams of the firing mechanism, and he de- scribed in technical detail the in- ternal workings of a firearm to show how a bump stock works. The Trump administration en- acted the ban after a gunman opened fire at a Las Vegas concert in 2017, one of the deadliest massa- cres in modern American history. The decision was a forceful re- jection of one of the government’s few steps to address gun violence, particularly as legislative efforts have stalled in Congress. It also highlighted the deep divisions on the court as the country continues to grapple with mass shootings. The narrowly written decision was not a Second Amendment challenge. Rather, it is one of sev- eral cases this term seeking to un- dercut the power of administra- tive agencies. The court has yet to issue many of those opinions, in- cluding a challenge to a seminal precedent known as Chevron. However, the bump stock decision could signal support among the conservative justices for curbing the authority of such agencies. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dis- sented, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jack- son. \n# \nisolated coast of northeastern Quebec — in months.

Gérard  Tsatselam boarded the ferryboat and settled in his usual place, on a reclining seat, at the back of a cold, unlit room that would have been packed in summer. Uneasy, he sat shrouded in his large, black coat as high winter winds delayed the boat’s arrival in the village where he was trying to save the church. Except for a quick stopover for a funeral, he had not visited his parish — in Unamen Shipu, an In- digenous reserve on the frigid, \nNow, returning to Unamen Shipu, Father Gérard planned to comfort his dwindling flock and restore the faith of those who had left. He would try to assuage the rage that had fueled threats to burn down the presbytery and to cast his predecessor’s body into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. “It’s a complex terrain,” Father Gérard said. “People are still Christian. They’re religious, they believe, they still have faith. But they’re really hurting a lot.” \nMr. Biden and his allies are working furiously to build a com- parable online army, trying to per- suade, or in some cases pay, peo- ple to sing Mr. Biden’s praises to their large followings. They are finding that social media feeds are difficult territory for an 81-year- old president whose policies on Gaza and immigration are unpop- ular on the left. \nAnother reason behind his un- ease was the enduring fallout from the accusations of sexual and other abuse by a predecessor, a Belgian priest. Though the transgressions dated back dec- ades, during what Father Gérard called  the  Roman  Catholic Church’s “colonial” era, dealing with the parishioners’ anger and distrust had fallen to him — a priest and missionary from the Central African nation of Camer- \nFather Gérard had been Una- men Shipu’s priest for four years, and his predecessor long dead, when the accusations were lev- eled in 2017. “The moment they came out, the dynamics changed,” he had said before boarding. “There’s a before and an after.” \n“It’s clear we have to use influ- encers or creators as a way to  Continued on Page A12 \n# \n# \n\n# \n# \nJustice Sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench, a prac- tice reserved for profound dis- agreements and the first such an- nouncement of the term. “The ma- jority puts machine guns back in civilian hands,” she said. \nThis was the pope who asked, “Who am I to judge?” in response to a question about gay priests in 2013. He announced last year that he would allow priests to bless same-sex couples, defying con- servative critics in the Roman Catholic Church. And he apolo- gized only weeks ago, in a state- \nAbout a month after the Ala- bama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos were to be considered children un- der the law, Andrew T. Walker, an ethicist at a Southern Baptist sem- inary in Kentucky, called a friend with an idea: to spread Alabama’s argument beyond Alabama. \n“When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “A bump-stock-equipped semiau- tomatic rifle fires ‘automatically more than one shot, without man- ual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.’ Because I, like Con- gress, call that a machine gun, I respectfully dissent.” \nment from the Vatican, for us-ing an offensive Italian term for gay men at a conference  of bishops. \nThe Alabama ruling, which had threatened access to in vitro fertil- ization and other reproductive services in the state, caught many Americans, including conserva- tives, off guard. The idea that fer- tility treatments could be morally and legally questionable rattled many anti-abortion voters who had used such procedures to ex- pand their families. And it further frayed the increasingly tense alli- ance between the anti-abortion movement and the Republican Party, which saw political peril in going after I.V.F. \n\nPope Francis \nUnder the National Firearms Act of 1934, Congress outlawed machine guns, defined as “any  Continued on Page A15 \nPainful Reminder of School Shooting The building in Parkland, Fla., where an attack took place in 2018 is being torn down.

On Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention, the country’s largest Protestant de- nomination, voted to condemn the use of reproductive technologies like I.V.F. that end in the destruc- tion of “frozen embryonic human beings.” The resolution passed by what appeared to be the over- whelming majority of Baptists that gathered in Indianapolis for their annual meeting. \nIn interviews and public state- ments, some supporters of more acceptance for L.G.B.T.Q.
