Instead, they are publicly beginning to embrace the logic of possessing the bomb, arguing that recent missile ex- changes with Israel underscore the need for a far more powerful deterrent. \nIn a 5-to-4 decision, the justices found that the deal, carefully ne- gotiated over years with states, tribes, local governments and in- dividuals, had broken a basic ten- et of bankruptcy law by shielding members of the Sackler family from lawsuits without the consent \nIn interviews with a dozen American, European, Iranian and Israeli officials and with outside experts, the cumulative effect of this surge appears clear: Iran has cemented its role as a “threshold” nuclear state, walking right up to the line of building a weapon with- out stepping over it. \nof those who might sue. The plan for Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, the drug widely considered to have ignited the crisis, was unusual because it offered broad protections that the Sackler family, who controlled the company, had demanded for years even as the Sacklers avoided de- claring bankruptcy themselves. “The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the ta- ble for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samu- el A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson. While he acknowledged that the decision left the plan in limbo, Jus- tice Gorsuch wrote that the threat of future lawsuits from opioid vic- tims, states, government entities and others might compel the Sacklers “to negotiate consensual releases on terms more favorable to opioid victims.” \n# \n# \nthe city of Kharkiv.

But despite its losses, Russia is recruiting 25,000 to 30,000 new soldiers a month — roughly as many as are exiting the battle- field, U.S. officials said.
