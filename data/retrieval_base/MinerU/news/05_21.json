But not everyone in Iran was in mourning. \n# \nNEWS ANALYSIS Tehran Is Aiming to Will Next President Project Stability Tread Carefully? Amid Tensions \nThis article is by  Farnaz Fassihi , Vivian Yee  and  Leily Nikounazar . \n# \nIn their three years in power, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and his equally hard-line foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdol- lahian, did everything they could to consolidate the “Axis of Resist- ance” against the United States and Israel. \nIran sought to project a sense of order and control on Monday by quickly naming an acting presi- dent and foreign minister a day af- ter a helicopter crash killed both leaders. The change in leadership came at a time of heightened ten- sions in the Middle East and do- mestic discontent in Iran, where many residents have called for an end to decades of repressive cleri- cal rule. \nThey funded Hamas and Hezbollah. They armed the Houthis, feeding the militia intel- ligence that fueled attacks on \nIran’s supreme leader, Ayatol- lah Ali Khamenei, announced five days of mourning for the presi- dent, Ebrahim Raisi, 63, and the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, 60, who died when their helicopter plunged into a mountainous area near an Iranian city, Jolfa. The men had been re- turning from Iran’s border with Azerbaijan after inaugurating a joint dam project. \n# \n# \nIran’s Armed Forces said they had created a committee to inves- tigate the crash, which state me- dia attributed to a “technical fail- ure.” \nLast week, days before their deaths, they approved talks with the United States through inter- mediaries aimed at making sure the war in Gaza was not the prelude to a wider war in the Middle East. And they stopped just short of making those bombs, at least as far as Ameri- can intelligence agencies and international inspectors can determine. \nfront door with a so-called ghost gun, an AR-style rifle that Mr. Smith had assembled from parts ordered online. Within seconds, he opened fire, hitting Mr. Keys five times. \n# \n# \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — The se- quence of events that led to the killing of Jason Keys was so con- founding that friends and family did not quite believe it until they saw the video evidence played in court. \nMr. Raisi, a hard-line cleric who came of age during the country’s Islamic Revolution, oversaw a deadly crackdown on protesters as the head of the judiciary in 2019 and as president in 2022. He was widely viewed as a possible suc- cessor to Ayatollah Khamenei, 85. Ayatollah Khamenei on Mon- day named Iran’s first vice presi- dent, Mohammad Mokhber, act- ing president and announced that Mr. Mokhber would organize elec- tions for a new president within 50 days. A conservative political op- erative, Mr. Mokhber has a long history of involvement in large business conglomerates closely tied to the ayatollah. \n# \n“What are you shooting for?” a relative of Mr. Keys can be heard asking on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident.

While Ms. Keys ducked behind the car to call 911, she heard multiple gunshots. She emerged to find her husband mortally wounded. It took a moment for everyone to realize that the shots had come \nJERUSALEM — The chief prosecutor at the world’s top crim- inal court on Monday announced that he was seeking arrest war- rants for the leaders of both Israel and Hamas on charges of crimes against humanity, a strong rebuke that equated Prime Minister Ben- jamin Netanyahu of Israel with his Hamas counterpart, Yahya Sin- war, and compounded the grow- ing international alarm at Israel’s conduct in Gaza. \nMr. Keys and his wife, Charae Williams Keys, were getting into their car after a Father’s Day visit in 2021 with her grandparents in a leafy neighborhood near Walnut Hill Park in Columbus, Ohio. A 72- year-old neighbor carrying a rifle accosted them in the belief, he lat- er told the police, that Mr. Keys had let the air out of his daughter’s tires and poisoned his lawn. \nThe question now is whether their successors — almost cer- tain to be from the same hard- line camp, American officials suspect — will show similar caution. And whether, in the cauldron of internal Iranian power plays, and an all-consum- ing presidential election in the United States, it will even be possible to keep up the sliver of communications between Wash- ington and Tehran. \nIt was an encounter emblemat- ic of gun violence in America to- day, a dispute that might not have turned deadly but for firearms in increasingly easy reach. And it was an episode that exemplified a striking spread in fatal shootings nationwide since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 — a period  Continued on Page A10 \nMr. Keys, who was carrying a \nIn a statement, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, said that after in- vestigating Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s counter- attack on Gaza he had decided to apply for arrest warrants for Mr. Sinwar, Hamas’s leader within Gaza; Muhammad Deif, Hamas’s military  leader;  and  Ismail Haniyeh, the movement’s Qatar- based political leader. Mr. Khan also said he was requesting war- rants for Mr. Netanyahu and for Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant. \nIran’s cabinet appointed Ali Bagheri Kani, a deputy foreign minister, as the ministry’s “care- taker,” the IRNA state news agency reported. Mr. Bagheri Kani has served as Iran’s chief nu- clear negotiator and was involved in a deal last year that freed im- prisoned Americans in exchange for several jailed Iranians and eventual access to about \\$6 billion in Iranian funds. \n“The thing about Raisi was that he was the supreme leader’s man,” said Dennis Ross, the longtime Mideast negotiator, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the 85-year-old head of state who has led the country since 1989. “He allows engage- ment, but no compromise. His team will inflict damage but keep it within bounds. They don’t want Continued on Page A8 \n\nWhile Mr. Khan’s request must still be approved by judges from the court, the announcement forms one of the harshest rebukes of Israel’s strategy in its seven- month campaign against Hamas that has killed tens of thousands of Gazan civilians. It also heightens scrutiny of Hamas’s actions at the start of the war in October, when Hamas fighters led a raid that killed more than 1,000 people and abducted hundreds more. \n# \n\nThe question of what is and what is not technically a sand- wich grips us tightly. \nThe question won’t die. But one day I will, and I can imagine that the last thing I TEJAL hear will be some guy explaining to RAO me why a hot dog is a sandwich, or why CRITIC’S a hamburger is a NOTEBOOK sandwich, or why my soul leaving my body as I breathe my last breath is also a sandwich. \n“Today we once again underline that international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to all,” Mr. Khan said in his state- ment. “No foot soldier, no com- mander, no civilian leader — no one — can act with impunity.” For now, the announcement is largely symbolic. Israel is not a member of the court and does not recognize its jurisdiction in Israel or Gaza, meaning that Israeli leaders would face no risk of ar- rest at home. \nCargo Ship Refloated The Dali, which crashed into a bridge in Baltimore, was guided back to a berth Monday.

It took the absurd sand- wich question seriously in a civil court case, then appeared to land on the wrong answer. \n# \nThis article is by  Jonah E. Bromwich ,  Ben Protess  and  Maggie Haberman . \nThe tension came to a head af- ter the prosecution rested its case and the defense called its witness, Robert J. Costello, a lawyer who had once advised Mr. Cohen. The defense saw Mr. Costello as a foil to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s onetime personal lawyer and longtime henchman. \nJudges can also take months to uphold requests for arrest war- rants. But if they do issue war- rants, those named could be ar- rested if they travel to one of the court’s 124 member nations,which include most European countries but not the United States. \nAre these sandwiches to you?

The taco is its own glori- ous archetype, its own indisput- able and formidable department of joy. \nAnd the defense’s only real wit- ness was so defiant that the judge, after excoriating him, cleared the courtroom. \nThe prosecution’s star witness, Michael D. Cohen, admitted on the stand to stealing from former President Donald J. Trump’s com- pany. Mr. Trump’s courtroom en- tourage included three supporters charged with felonies of their own. \nThe trial’s first five weeks fea- tured dramatic descriptions of sex and scandal, and the final phase of testimony on Monday showed no signs of a letup, as the courtroom \nitself is trifling.
