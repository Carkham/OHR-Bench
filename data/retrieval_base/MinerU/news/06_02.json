Rashbaum  and  Jonah E. Bromwich . \n# \nWASHINGTON — Now that former  President  Donald  J. Trump is a convicted criminal, the Democratic Party finds itself wrestling with a choice that will help define this year’s presiden- tial race: Should it try to push his felonies to the center of the elec- tion? \n“This is long from over,” Donald J. Trump, the former president and current felon, declared on Thursday, moments after a Man- hattan jury convicted him on 34 counts of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal. \nMr. Trump, the presumptive Re- publican nominee, is banking on the jury not having the final word on the case. He has already out- lined a plan to appeal a verdict that on Friday he labeled   $\\mathrm{{}^{u}a}$  scam.” \nThe route Democrats take may determine not only President Bi- den’s fortunes but also, they say, the future of American democra- cy. Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernat- ural ability to survive even this po- litical peril. \nBut even if the former — and possibly future — president could persuade voters to ignore his con- viction, the appellate courts might not be so sympathetic. Several le- gal experts cast doubt on his chances of success, and noted that the case could take years to snake through the courts, all but ensur- ing he will still be a felon when vot- ers head to the polls in November. And so, after a five-year investi- gation and a seven-week trial, Mr. Trump’s New York legal odyssey is only beginning. \nPost-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — in- cluding current and former mem- bers  of  Congress,  statewide elected officials, veteran strat- egists, Democratic National Com- mittee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s convic- tion makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to \n# \nwith faraway loved ones and calls for help in emergencies. “But now, things have gotten worse,” she said. \nest.

Teenagers scrolled In- stagram. One man texted his girl- friend. And men crowded around a phone streaming a soccer match while the group’s first female leader spoke. \n# \nShe was kneading jenipapo berries to make a black body paint and wearing ropes of jewelry made from snail shells. Lately, the youth had become less interested in making such dyes and jewelry, she said. “Young people have got- ten lazy because of the internet,” she said. “They’re learning the ways of the white people.” Then she paused and added, \nThe former president’s sup- porters are calling on the U.S. Su- preme Court to intervene, though that is highly unlikely. In a more likely appeal to a New York court, Mr. Trump would have avenues to attack the conviction, the experts said, but far fewer than he has claimed. The experts noted that the judge, whose rulings helped shape the case, stripped some of the prosecution’s most precarious arguments and evidence from the trial. \nThey have preserved this way of life for hundreds of years through isolation — some villages can take a week to reach.

The New York Times traveled deep into the Amazon to visit Marubo villages to understand what happens when a tiny, closed civilization suddenly opens to the world. \n“I do think it is the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is now a convicted felon and just how un- precedented this is,” said former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination against Mr. Biden in 2020. \nThe 2,000-member tribe is one of hundreds across Brazil that are suddenly logging on with Starlink, the satellite-internet service from Space X, Mr. Musk’s private space company.

But this was happening in a remote In- digenous village in one of the most isolated stretches of the planet.

Merchan, who steered the trial through po- litical and legal minefields even as Mr. Trump hurled invective at him and his family. Justice Merchan, a no-nonsense former prosecutor, said that he was keenly aware “and protective of” Mr. Trump’s rights, including his right to “de- fend himself against political at- tacks.” \nMr. Biden himself has deployed a two-pronged strategy, speaking carefully about Mr. Trump’s legal problems even as his campaign grows more aggressive: On Fri- day evening, it fired off a state- ment that referred, for the first time, to “Convicted Felon Donald Trump.” \n# \nON THE WEST BANK  Settlers in places like Tekoa have sped up seizures of Palestinian land.

The video went viral, eventu- ally drawing more than 58 million views. Glay, who is 43 and lives in Baltimore, began holding online classes to guide people through the journal. Over the next few months, people who watched his videos bought more than 40,000 copies of the book on TikTok, and Glay earned more than \\$150,000 in commissions. By December, he had quit his job as a sales repre- sentative for Home Depot and now runs his own business, “Happy Healin,” which offers sub- scribers spiritual mentorship and coaching through Zoom sessions. Glay is part of the army of Tik- Tok influencers who helped turn “The Shadow Work Journal” into a mega best seller. He’s so closely associated with the book that peo- ple often assume he wrote it. “It became a daily thing to tell people I’m not the author,” he said. \nJOHANNESBURG — The Afri- can National Congress lost its po- litical monopoly on South Africa after election results on Saturday showed that with almost all of the votes counted, the party had re- ceived only about 40 percent, fall- ing short of winning an absolute majority for the first time since vanquishing Africa’s last white- led regime 30 years ago. \n# \nof the world’s highest unemploy- ment rates, shortages of electrici- ty and water and rampant crime, the governing party still bested its competitors but fell far short of the nearly 58 percent of the vote it won in the last election, in 2019.
