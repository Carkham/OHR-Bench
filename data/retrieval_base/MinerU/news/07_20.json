It raised broader questions about Crowd- Strike’s testing processes and what repercussions such software firms should face when flaws in their code cause major disrup- tions. \nHe delivered an angry, defen- sive rant on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He showed foreign policy chops at a news conference. He wrote a long letter to “fellow Dem- ocrats” demanding an end to the calls for him to step aside. He con- fronted lawmakers on a Zoom call that devolved into a tense, heated exchange about his age and men- tal competency. \nAirlines grounded flights. Oper- ators of 911 lines could not respond to emergencies. Hospitals can- celed surgeries. Retailers closed for the day. And the actions all traced back to a batch of bad com- puter code. \nA flawed software update sent out by a little-known cybersecuri- ty company caused chaos and dis- ruption around the world on Fri- day. The company, CrowdStrike, based in Austin, Texas, makes software used by multinational corporations, government agen- cies and scores of other organiza- tions to protect against hackers and online intruders. \nWhile outages are common, of- ten caused by technical errors or cyberattacks, the scale of what un- folded on Friday was unparal- leled. \nTwelve days ago, the president and his closest family members and advisers went on the offen- sive, determined to end what al- ready had been nearly two weeks of hand-wringing over his listless performance at a debate on June 27. The result was a flurry of inter- views, rallies, defiant meetings with his closest allies and im- promptu campaign stops — all in- tended to rebut the premise that he was too old and frail to win a second term. \nCheck-in kiosks weren’t working at La Guardia Airport, forcing passengers to seek human help. \n“This is historic,” said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research offi- cer at WithSecure, a cybersecuri- ty company. “We haven’t had an incident like this.” \nBut when CrowdStrike sent its update  on  Thursday  to  its customers that run Microsoft Windows software, computers be- gan to crash. \nGeorge Kurtz, CrowdStrike’s chief executive, said that the com- pany took responsibility for the mistake and that a software fix had been released. He warned that it could be some time before tech systems returned to normal. “We’re deeply sorry for the im- pact  that  we’ve  caused  to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this,” he said in an in- terview on Friday on NBC’s “To- day” show. \nThe fallout, which was immedi- ate and inescapable, highlighted the brittleness of global technol- ogy infrastructure. The world has become reliant on Microsoft and a handful of cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike. So when a single flawed piece of software is re- leased over the internet, it can al- most instantly damage countless companies and organizations that depend on the technology as part of everyday business. \nBut almost every step was un- dercut by his own fumbles and the steady drumbeat of calls from his friends and allies for him to step aside, even from loyalists like the actor George Clooney. Together, it was evidence that nothing he was doing was having much impact.

He dispensed some advice for the veteran financiers, who had decades more experience in Republican politics than he did: Their emphasis on political adver- tising was misplaced, he said. Tesla, his electric car company, barely advertises, he said, but had still built a cult following through word of mouth. Why couldn’t Re- publicans do the same? \n# \n# \nMILWAUKEE — A little over two months ago, Elon Musk found himself at Montsorrel, the palatial Palm Beach compound of Nelson Peltz, the famed activist investor.

The verdict opens the way for a potential prisoner swap between \nas the party’s weak ground game, according to a person with direct knowledge of what transpired. But Mr. Musk had a darker mes- sage that spring day. He told the group that this would be the last free election in America — be- cause if President Biden won, mil- lions of undocumented immi- grants would be legalized and de- mocracy would be finished, ac- cording to the person. \ngrounds well, having stayed in the guesthouse. The conversation was a bit dif- ferent than usual, though: Mr. Peltz had gathered a group of bil- lionaire conservative financiers — including Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and the hedge-funder John Paulson — to discuss  whether  Republicans could seize Senate control, as well \nREHOVOT, Israel — In a rare breach of Israel’s multilayered air-defense system, a drone fired by the Houthi militia in Yemen slammed into an apartment build- ing near the United States Embas- sy branch office in Tel Aviv early Friday, killing at least one person and wounding eight others. \nThe most important thing that the financiers could do, Mr. Musk said, was ask two people to sup- port Mr. Trump, and urge them to ask two more. Two people by two people — that’s how the former president would win. \nMr. Dobbs on the set at CNN. \nThe harsh sentence repre- sented the first espionage convic- tion of a Western reporter in mod- ern Russia. But the expedited na- ture of the case suggested that Moscow might be ready to trade Mr. Gershkovich. The proceed- ings were recently moved up by more than three weeks, and the court concluded the case, a process  that  usually  takes months, in a matter of weeks, with only three hearings. \n# \nPentagon officials expressed doubt that the drone had specifi- cally targeted the U.S. building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 peo- ple. \nContinued on Page A14 \n\n# \nLou Dobbs, the conservative television and radio host who loomed large over the cable news landscape for decades at CNN and Fox Business, and who later used his platform to promote baseless conspiracy theories and to lend unwavering support to former President Donald J. Trump, has died. He was 78. \nThe court said in a statement that Mr. Gershkovich did not ad- mit guilt, but said “the totality of the evidence presented to the court was sufficient to render a guilty verdict.” Judge Andrei N. Mineev, who presided over the case, sentenced Mr. Gershkovich to two years less than prosecutors were asking. \nThe Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the country’s defense systems had apparently picked up the presence of the drone but had failed to register it as a threat. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrap- nel scattered on the streets. “We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and in- tercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday. \nHis death was confirmed on Thursday on Mr. Dobbs’s website and social media accounts after Mr. Trump announced it on the Truth Social platform. No cause of death was given, and where or when he died was not immedi- ately clear. Mr. Dobbs had been absent from “The Great America Show,”  his  podcast  on  the iHeartRadio network, for several weeks. \nAt no time during the case, how- ever, did prosecutors publicly pro- vide any evidence to back up the charge, and the trial was held be- hind closed doors. The Russian ju- dicial system for years has served as a tool of President Vladimir V. Putin’s  domestic  repression, handing down convictions and long sentences in cases with clear political motivations. \nAnother Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the con- dition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to pene- trate Israeli airspace. \nWith his boyish face and author- itative demeanor, Mr. Dobbs had an on-air presence that could swing from folksy and avuncular  Continued on Page A21 \nIn Russia, once a person is charged with a crime, it is virtual- \n# \nIsraeli officials did not an- Continued on Page A5 \nly impossible to get an acquittal in  Continued on Page A8 \nFirst responders at the funeral of a father of two killed in the attack on Donald J.
