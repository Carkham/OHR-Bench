His Labour Party won around a third of the vote. \n# \nVoters in Swing States Express Frustration \nOlder U.K. Parties Lose Support to Newcomers \nThis article is by  Jack Healy , Mitch Smith ,  Eduardo Medina  and Robert Chiarito . \n# \nPHOENIX — Jeanne Wino- grad, 72, a Democrat in Phoenix, is such a ride-or-die fan of President Biden that, on Valentine’s Day, she mailed him a card to say his vigor, not his age, would shape the presi- dential election. But after a week of panic attacks after his dismal debate performance, she felt com- pelled to send him another card. \nhanded the Labour Party a land- slide election victory this week, but one laden with asterisks. Prime Minister Keir Starmer took office on Friday with a commanding majority in the British Parliament, yet in terms of the total number of ballots cast, his party won only a third of the vote, less than what it got in 2017 when it lost to the Conserva- tives. Labour made inroads across Britain, yet its wins were often eclipsed by the Tory losses, including that of Liz Truss, the unpopular former prime minister who was evicted from her seat. The thundering mutiny of the voters may have been the single biggest message of Britain’s election. It has ushered in a new era of Labour government, left the Conservatives to nurse the worst defeat in their history, and stands as a warning to incum- bents everywhere of the hazards of failing to deliver on your \n“I just love Biden, but he’s frail,” Ms. Winograd said. “Pass the ba- ton.” \nAs Mr. Biden and his allies have scrambled to fix the damage from the debate last week, and to insist he will not bow out of the race, doz- ens of Democratic voters have said they no longer believe he can accomplish the one thing they ur- gently want — a defeat of former President Donald J. Trump. They are desperate for the party to find a Plan B. \nIn 80 interviews at Independ- ence Day parades, pie-eating con- tests and political events this holi- day in the political battlegrounds of Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, more than half of voters who had supported Mr. Biden in 2020 now said he should drop out of the race. About a quarter said he should stay in. The rest were unsure. \n# \n# \nBut Labour’s triumph was only one of several crosscurrents that revealed the extraordinary vola- tility of the modern British elec- torate: the rise of Reform U.K., an insurgent anti-immigration party, which won more than four million votes; the plummeting vote share of the major parties; the lowest voter turnout in dec- ades, and the flare-up of the Gaza War as a campaign issue that stung Labour candidates, even Mr. Starmer. \n# \nfelonies by a Manhattan jury in May — a verdict that came after civil judgments against him for personal and professional mis- deeds — there was no significant groundswell within the Republi- can Party to force him out of the race in favor of a less-tainted candidate. Even though many Republican officeholders and strategists privately loathe him, they fell in line and made clear they would stick with him no matter how many scandals piled up. \n# \n# \nOne of America’s political parties has a presidential candi- date who is really old and show- ing it. The other has a presiden- tial candidate who is a convicted felon, adjudicated sexual abuser, business fraudster and self- described aspiring dictator for a day. And also really old. One of the parties is up in arms about its nominee and trying to figure out how to re- place him at the last minute. The other is not. \nThe turmoil engulfing the Dem- ocratic Party had left them sleep- deprived and divided about a path forward, with some saying it would be pragmatic to dump Mr. Biden and others arguing that he was Democrats’ best — or only? — option in November. \n# \n# \nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia — From the outside, the last few years looked like the peak of Abdulaziz Almuzaini’s career. \nand former President Donald J.

And as the conservative Islamic kingdom loosened up, Mr. Almuzaini was being publicly celebrated — as re- cently as a few months ago — as one of the homegrown talents shaping its nascent entertain- ment industry. \nWhile he comfortably held his own seat in London, Mr. Starmer won 17,000 fewer votes than in 2019, thanks in part to a chal- lenge by an independent who channeled anger on the left over Labour’s stance on Israel and the war in Gaza. \nSeveral voters said Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris was the  Continued on Page A15 \nUntil last week, Democrats had also resigned themselves to a candidate many considered far  Continued on Page A14 \nA VOW TO STAY President Bidenwas forceful in a visit to Wiscon- sin, a key state.
