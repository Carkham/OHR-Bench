No. 60,241 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nFRIDAY, AUGUST 9, 2024 \n# \n# \n\nDemocrat Successful in Conservative District \nFROM TAXES TO TIKTOK \n# \nEconomic Agenda Vastly Different From Term in White House \nWASHINGTON — Representa- tive Tim Walz was traveling across his conservative, rural dis- trict in 2014, holding town halls across southern Minnesota, when a voter confronted him with a prickly question about his support for the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama’s sig- nature legislation was supposed to save families thousands of dol- lars in health care premiums but still proved costly for some, the voter said. “What happened?” the man demanded. \n# \nWASHINGTON — At his con- vention speech last month, former President Donald J. Trump de- clared that his new economic agenda would be built around a plan to eliminate taxes on tips, claiming that the idea would uplift the middle class and provide relief to hospitality workers around the country. \nSome Democrats in politically vulnerable swing seats like Mr. Walz’s who had supported the bill tried to backpedal from their vote, a choice that voters punished them for at the ballot box later that year. \n“Everybody  loves  it,”  Mr. Trump said to cheers. “Waitresses and caddies and drivers.” While the cost and feasibility of \nDonald J. Trump’s agenda has some notable reversals. \nInstead,  Senator  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who shared the stage with Mr. Walz, re- called in an interview that he stood by his decision. “He didn’t try to hide from the vote,” she said. “He leaned into it.” Mr. Walz acknowledged there was still work to be done on health care but defended the law to the crowd. “Don’t pretend that there was some type of safe harbor be- fore this where everything was just peachy keen,” he said. \nGolden Again Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won a second straight gold in the 400-meter hurdles, doing so at the Paris Games in a world-record- setting 50.37 seconds. Her compatriot, Noah Lyles, took bronze in the 200 meters, later revealing he has Covid.

He supported a successful effort to raise the min- imum wage and opposed Republi- can-advanced  legislation  that could subject doctors who per- form abortions to criminal penal- ties. \n# \nScott’s administration. The administration said that holding any of the public meetings would jeopardize a lawsuit the city had filed accusing numerous opi- oid makers and distributors of causing the crisis by flooding Bal- timore with pills. City leaders be- lieve the case could result in a transformative amount of money for its overdose response — far more than the \\$45 million it col- lected in a settlement with a single company that shipped relatively few drugs to Baltimore. \nBALTIMORE — For years, Bal- timore’s leaders gave overdoses little public attention, even as the death rate swelled to unprece- dented levels. But for a few weeks this summer, it seemed that the city would respond to its drug epi- demic with new urgency. The City Council was about to hold four hearings — planned af-ter The New York Times and The Baltimore Banner reported that the overdose rate here was far higher than in any other major American city. And Mayor Bran- don Scott had just announced a \nthe idea has been questioned by economists and tax analysts, la- bor experts have noted another irony: As president, Mr. Trump tried to take tips away from work- ers and give the money to their employers. \nThis article is by  Rory Smith , Talya Minsberg  and  Jenny Vrentas . \nPARIS — Duco Telgenkamp came to the Paris Olympics with his strategy clear in his mind. The keys, he knew, were to be decisive and clear and, above all, to go early. “You have to get your move in first,” he said. “You have to give people a sign it will be a fist bump.” \n\\$45 million legal settlement with a drug manufacturer, raising the possibility of well-funded new public health efforts to combat the epidemic, which had claimed nearly 6,000 lives here in the past six years. \nThe reversal is one of many that Mr. Trump has made in his bid to return to the presidency and un- derscores his malleability in elec- tion-year  policymaking.  From TikTok to crypto currencies, the former president has been re- inventing his platform on the fly as he aims to attract different swaths of voters. At times, Mr. Trump appears to be staking out new positions to differentiate him- self from Vice President Kamala Harris or, perhaps, just to please crowds. \nAt the same time, his voting record reflected the conservative tilt of his district. He voted in favor of a measure calling for the with- drawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 90 days, but after it failed, he approved legislation providing fresh funds for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nBut hours before the first hear- ing, as demonstrators prepared to rally outside City Hall, the council president abruptly canceled the \nThe decision to cancel the hear- ings was in keeping with the city’s  \nThe assertiveness is necessary. Like all athletes and staff mem- bers in the Netherlands’ Olympic delegation, Telgenkamp, a mem- ber of his country’s field hockey team, was told before arriving in Paris that handshakes, high-fives and hugs were forbidden. Official team policy held that the fist bump was the only permissible physical greeting. \nAfter a terror plot canceled Taylor Swift’s Vienna shows, her fans gathered for a cathartic singalong. \nHe was endorsed by the Na- tional Rifle Association, took its campaign donations and once re- ceived an “A” rating from the group — a score that would abruptly fall once he ran for gov- ernor and began to champion tighter firearm restrictions, in- cluding an assault weapons ban.

Pandemic-era restric- tions hollowed out the last two edi- tions of the Games, in Tokyo in 2021 and Beijing a year later. Paris styled itself as the moment the Olympic flame could at last be — safely — reignited. \nDEBATE  The presidential candi- \ndates have agreed to meet Sept. 10 in a matchup on ABC.

For athletes, it has meant a completely different experience from the ones in Japan and China, where bubbles were imposed to allow the events to take place. After  qualifying  for  those Games, athletes had to navigate a bureaucratic Covid maze. They needed multiple negative tests from specific clinics, an endless stack of paperwork, a health- tracking app on their phones and a flurry of QR codes to present to officials upon arrival. \n# \nWASHINGTON — After Repre- sentative Cori Bush, Democrat of Missouri, became the second member of the left-wing “squad” to lose her re-election bid, she placed the blame for her defeat solely on one organization: the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \nOn Tuesday, its investment paid off: Wesley Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor who aligned himself with Israel, defeated Ms. Bush in the Democratic primary as voters in the district rallied be- hind him. \n# \n“Last night, Wesley Bell, a pro- Israel progressive, achieved a consequential victory over an in- cumbent anti-Israel detractor,” said  Marshall  Wittmann,  a spokesman for AIPAC. “Once again, a progressive pro-Israel Democrat has prevailed over a candidate who represents the ex- tremist fringe that is hostile to the Jewish state.” \nIn Tokyo, athletes, visiting offi- cials and members of the news media were tested for Covid every four days. In Beijing, everyone was tested daily. The only time athletes were unmasked was dur- ing competition, and even then their time without face coverings was minimal. Athletes gasping for breath at the National Stadium in Tokyo were handed masks and hand sanitizer seconds after fin- ishing grueling races. \n“All they did was radicalize me, so now they need to be afraid,” Ms. Bush said in a fiery speech after her loss on Tuesday evening. “AIPAC, I’m coming to tear your  kingdom  down!”  she shouted. \nthe shows, it’s the community coming together and feeling safe at her concerts, and Swifties let- ting their guard down. And this just shifted all of that,” she said. “How can we do that now that we feel we are targeted?” \n# \n# \nVIENNA — Just as she was boarding her flight at Boston Lo- gan International Airport headed for a Taylor Swift concert in Vien- na,  Mary  DePetris  excitedly checked the online fan group, Swiftie Nation. \nThe  pro-Israel  organization made no secret of its plans to tar- get Ms. Bush, who had opposed providing Israel with funding for the war in Gaza. Through a politi- cal action committee, the group pumped more than \\$8 million into the race. \nbefore takeoff, organizers can- celed all three shows. Ms. De- Petris, 47, stepped onto the plane and broke the news to some of her fellow passengers. “Half the plane was crying,” Ms. DePetris said. “It’s not just about \nIt was the second time in recent months that AIPAC has played a critical role in a Democratic pri- mary race.
