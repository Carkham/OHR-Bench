Most of the Trump tariffs areexpected toremainin place, but Mr. Biden plans to go beyondthosebyraisingleviesin areas that the president showered with subsidies in the 2022 In fla- tionReductionAct \nReagan, the year was 1982, and the battlefield was Lebanon, where Israelis were attacking Palestinian fighters. The conver- sation Mr. Reagan had with PrimeMinister Menachem Begin that day, Aug. 12, would be one of the few times aides ever heard the usually mild-mannered presi- dent so exercised. \"It is a holocaust,' Mr. Reagan told Mr. Begin angrily. Mr. Begin, whose parents and brother were killed by the Nazis, snapped back, “Mr. President, I know all about a holocaust.\" Nonetheless, Mr. Reagan re- torted, it had to stop. Mr. Begin heeded the demand. Twenty minutes later, he called back and told the president that he had ordered a halt to the shelling. “\"1 didn't know I had that kind of power” Mr. Reagan marveled to aides afterward. It would not be the only time he would use it to rein in Israel. In fact, Mr. Reagan used the power of American arms several times toinfluenceIsraeli war policy, at different points order- ing warplanes and cluster muni- tions to be delayed or withheld. His actions take on new meaning four decades later,as President Biden delays a shipment of bombs and threatens to withhold other offensive weapons from Israel if it attacks Rafah, in southern Gaza. Even as Republicans rail againstMr.Biden,accusinghim of abandoning an ally in the middle of a war, supporters of the president's decision pointed to the Reagan precedent. If it was reasonable for the Republican  presidential icon to limit arms to impose his will on Israel, they argue, it should be acceptable for the current Democratic president to do thesame.

The administration is expected to raise that to as muchas100percentinorderto make it prohibitively expensive to buy a Chinese E.V. \nMr.Biden has previously raised concerns about Chinese electric vehicles,saying that internet-con- nec ted Chinese cars and trucks posed risks to national security because their operating systems could send sensitive information toBeijing.He took steps earlier this year to try and block those ve hi cles from entering the United States. \ntheIsraelDefenseForcesare making sufficient use of those tools. \nThe president is looking to ratchet up pressure on China and demonstratehis willingness to protect American manufacturing ahead of his face-off against Mr. Trumpin the November preside n- tial election. \nEvenso,thereport—which seemed at odds with itself in places—said theU.S.hadnohard proof of Israeli violations.Itnoted the difficulty of collecting reliable information from Gaza,Hamas's tactic of operating in civilian ar- eas,and thefact that“Israelhas not shared complete information to verify\" whether U.S. weapons havebeenused in specificinci- dents alleged to have involved hu- man rights law violations.
