That new test has sown confusion in the lower courts, with some judges striking down laws that had been on the books for decades. \nThe case decided Friday, United States v. Rahimi, asked whether a Texas man could be prosecuted under federal law making it a crime for people subject to domes- tic violence restraining orders to possess guns. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the ma- jority in the 8-to-1 decision, said that the answer was yes and that Second Amendment rights have limits. \n# \n# \ngenerals, not a permanent civilian annexation administered by Is- \n# \nThis article is by  Natan Oden- heimer ,  Ronen Bergman  and  Pat- rick Kingsley . \nMr. Smotrich’s June 9 speech at a West Bank gathering may make that posture harder to maintain. In it, he outlined a carefully or- chestrated program to take au- thority over the West Bank out of the hands of the Israeli military and turn it over to civilians work- ing for Mr. Smotrich in the defense ministry. Parts of the plan have al- ready been incrementally intro- duced over the past 18 months, and some authorities have al- ready been transferred to civil- ians. \n# \nAn influential member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition told settlers in the Is- raeli-occupied West Bank that the government is engaged in a stealthy effort to irreversibly change the way the territory is governed, to cement Israel’s con- trol over it without being accused of formally annexing it. In a taped recording of the speech,  the  official,  Bezalel Smotrich, can be heard suggest- ing at a private event earlier this month that the goal was to pre- vent the West Bank from becom- ing part of a Palestinian state.  $^\\mathrm{cr}\\mathrm{m}$   telling you, it’s mega-dra- \nRobert Winnett, the editor se- lected to run The Washington Post, will not take up that position, after reports raised questions about his ties to unethical news- gathering practices in Britain.

Past searches have been lengthy, culminating with an interview with Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who owns the paper. Mr. Winnett’s decision to stay in Britain is the latest in a series of convulsions at The Post. Early this month, Sally Buzbee, the pa- per’s executive editor, stunned the newsroom by abruptly resigning. That coincided with Mr. Lewis an- nouncing a plan to drastically re- make The Post newsroom, includ- \n“When a restraining order con- tains a finding that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, that individual may — consistent  with  the  Second Amendment — be banned from possessing firearms while the or- der is in effect,” the chief justice wrote. “Since the founding, our nation’s firearm laws have includ- ed provisions preventing individ- uals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.” Continued on Page A18 \nmatic,” Mr. Smotrich told the set- tlers. “Such changes change a sys- tem’s DNA.” \nWhile Mr. Smotrich’s opposition to ceding control over the West Bank is no secret, the Israeli gov- ernment’s official position is that the West Bank’s status remains open to negotiations between Is- raeli and Palestinian leaders.

And calls mentioning firearms rose 40 percent after an appeals court in New Orleans last February struck down a federal law blocking peo- ple subject to a domestic violence protection order from owning a gun. \n\n# \nAUSTIN, Texas — They call from work, to avoid being over- heard, or from home before some- one returns. They reach out be- cause they have decided to leave or need to ask a stranger if they should. \nTo listen to the National Domes- tic Violence Hotline is to witness how a confluence of stressors — high prices, a lack of affordable housing, easy access to firearms and drugs, the ubiquity of technol- ogy — can leave a person vulnera- ble to another’s cruelty and ma- nipulation. \nRobert Winnett withdrew. \nStaff members had been fo- cused on the outcomes of two cases resting with the nation’s highest court, involving gun ac- cess and the availability of a com- monly used abortion pill. On Fri- day, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court ruling, saying that the government may prohibit people subject to restraining or- ders from having guns. \n# \n# \nSpikes in calls often align with highly publicized events: natural disasters, recession, quarantine during the height of the coronavi- rus pandemic, a celebrity’s ac- knowledgment of being a survivor of domestic abuse. \n# \nBut even before the courts took up the gun case, the hotline, un- derstaffed  and  underfunded, struggled to keep pace with an es- calating number of calls over the years. The legal battles have un- derscored the pervasiveness of domestic violence and the strains on existing support for survivors. “That makes me sad that we need lives to be in jeopardy for this to become a national conver- sation around domestic violence, because it shouldn’t take a Su- Continued on Page A14 \nWASHINGTON — The floor of the United States House of Rep- resentatives is supposed to be a dignified place, where lawmak- ers refer to each other as “gentle- man” or “gentle lady,” speak only to the presiding officer, and never engage in personally dis- paraging remarks against rivals, an offense known as “engaging in personalities.” \nguilty of things that would nor- mally be considered unmention- able on the House floor?
