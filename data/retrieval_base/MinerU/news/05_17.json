Barnes ,  Eric Schmitt  and Lara Jakes . \nBRUSSELS — NATO allies are inching closer to sending troops into Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces, a move that would be an- other blurring of a previous red line and could draw the United States and Europe more directly into the war. \nConservative political leaders have portrayed the union cam- paign to organize Mercedes work- ers as an assault by outsiders on the region’s economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials on Friday. \nUkraine’s manpower shortage has reached a critical point, and its position on the battlefield in re- cent weeks has seriously wors- ened as Russia has accelerated its advances to take advantage of de- lays in shipments of American weapons. As a result, Ukrainian officials have asked their Ameri- can and NATO counterparts to help train 150,000 new recruits closer to the front line for faster deployment. \nSix Southern governors, includ- ing Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republi- can, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as “spe- cial interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.” Ala- bama recently passed a law in- tended to discourage union organ- izing. \n# \n# \nFor the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has tradi- tionally been weak, and provide momentum to the U.A.W.’s efforts to win over workers at other non- union automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla. \nSo far, the United States has said no, but Gen.

Their deci- sions will shape how accountable he can be held for trying to over- turn the last presidential election and his chances for re-election in the upcoming one. \n# \n# \nAfter the 2020 presidential elec- tion, as some Trump supporters falsely claimed that President Bi- den had stolen the office, many of them displayed a startling symbol outside their homes, on their cars and in online posts: an upside- down American flag. \n# \nIf the U.A.W. loses, it could sharply slow down a campaign by the union’s president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That ef- fort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram. \nFor now, he said, an effort inside Ukraine would put “a bunch of NATO trainers at risk” and would probably mean deciding whether to use precious air defenses to protect the trainers instead of crit- ical Ukrainian infrastructure near the battlefield. General Brown briefed reporters on his plane en route to a NATO meeting in Brus- sels. \nweek and a half before. Mr. Biden’s inauguration was three days away.  Alarmed  neighbors snapped photographs, some of which were recently obtained by The New York Times. Word of the flag filtered back to the court, peo- ple who worked there said in in- terviews. \nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia — To the government that charged him, he was a “lone wolf,” an off-kilter individual representing nobody but himself when he pumped at least four bullets into Prime Min- ister Robert Fico of Slovakia. The assassination attempt on Wednesday, however, has put a spotlight on a far wider collective malfunction in Slovakia. In this country in Central Europe, society and political culture are so bitterly divided that the violence attribut- ed to a man who the authorities say acted alone has become yet another club with which each side can beat the other. \n“I had no involvement whatso- ever in the flying of the flag,” Jus- tice Alito said in an emailed state- ment to The Times. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” \nOne of the homes flying an in- verted flag during that time was the residence of Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., in Al- exandria, Va., according to photo- graphs and interviews with neigh- bors. \nAs a part of NATO, the United States would be obligated under the alliance’s treaty to aid in the defense of any attack on the train- ers, potentially dragging America into the war. \nJudicial experts said in inter- views that the flag was a clear vio- lation of ethics rules, which seek to avoid even the appearance of bias, and could sow doubt about  Continued on Page A20 \nWhile the flag was up, the court was still contending with whether to hear a 2020 election case, with Justice Alito on the losing end of that decision.

The adminis- tration has also urged NATO allies not to send their troops. \n“There is a level of polarization that has never existed before in this country,” said Daniel Milo, a former government official re- sponsible for tracking disinforma- tion who now works for a technol- ogy company. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” he added. The Covid-19 pandemic, he said, hardened previously fluid lines into what have since become hos- tile camps, with little room for nu- ance. Roughly half the population welcomed vaccines and half re- jected them. “It became: Are you for or against? Do you believe or  Continued on Page A11 \n\n\nBut in February, President Em- manuel Macron of France said that “nothing should be ruled out” when it comes to sending Western troops to Ukraine. Mr. Macron has doubled down on his comment since then, even after senior American diplomats asked him to stop. \nThe government of Estonia has not ruled out the possibility of sending  troops  to  western Ukraine to take over rear roles that could free Ukrainian troops to go to the front, Estonia’s national security adviser said this week. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, backed Mr. Macron’s stance in an inter- view with the The Guardian last week. “Our troops have been training Ukrainians in Ukraine before the war,” he said, adding, “So returning to this tradition might be quite doable.” The American military has done training for Ukrainian troops \nAt a U.A.W. organizing event in Birmingham, Ala. \n# \n# \nHOUSTON — Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Thursday pardoned a man who was convicted of fatally shooting a protester during a Black Lives Matter demonstra- tion in the summer of 2020, fulfill- ing a promise he made last year amid pressure from conserva- tives. \nist online comments he had made and said that psychological ex- perts had found him to be “basi- cally a loaded gun.” As the par- dons board considered the case, lawyers with the Travis County district attorney, José Garza, met with the board to argue against a pardon. \n# \nThe Louvre is celebrating the Olympics with exercise classes.
