The New York Times identified hundreds of civilians abducted in the largest campaign of forced disappearances of the war. It all led back to one man. \nMalika, whose son also vanished in 2016, accused officials of cowardice. \n# \nCoordinated Rebuke for Israel From Norway, Spain and Ireland \nThis article is by  Aaron Boxer- man ,  Emma Bubola  and  Michael Levenson . \nJERUSALEM — Spain, Nor- way and Ireland said on Wednes- day that they would recognize an independent Palestinian state, de- livering a diplomatic blow to Is- rael that showed the country’s growing isolation on the world stage more than seven months into its devastating military offen- sive in the Gaza Strip. \nIn  closely  coordinated  an- nouncements, the leaders of the three countries said that Palestin- ian independence cannot wait for a negotiated peace deal with Is- rael’s  right-wing  government, which largely opposes a two-state solution, has been expanding set- tlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and is continuing to bombard Gaza without either top- pling Hamas or bringing home all its hostages. \n# \nHow the United States Backed Kidnapping, Torture and Murder in Afghanistan \n\nRaziq said after the killings, which took place in the winter of 2010, according to the witnesses and rela- tives of both men. “Because I will come back and do this again and again, and no one is going to stop me.” For years, American military leaders lionized Raziq as a model partner in Afghanistan, their “if only” ally in the battle against the Taliban: If only everyone fought like Raziq, we might actually win this war, American commanders often said. He ruled over the crucial battleground of Kandahar during a period when the United States had more troops on the ground than in any other chapter of the war, ultimately rising to lieutenant general thanks to the backing of the United States. American generals cycling through Afghanistan made regular pilgrim- ages to visit him, praising his courage, his ferocious war fighting and the loyalty he commanded from his  \nPrime Minister Benjamin Ne- tanyahu of Israel has also frus- trated world leaders — and two members of his war cabinet — with his refusal to establish a post- war plan to govern Gaza, where the health authorities say that more than 35,000 people have been killed. \n# \nstones. Over the loudspeakers at the local mosque, the Afghan police officers ordered everyone to gather: The commander was here. Dozens assembled in the mud square to listen as Abdul Raziq, one of America’s most important part- ners in the war against the Taliban, stood before the crowd, gesturing at two prisoners he had brought along to make his point. The prisoners knelt with their hands bound as Raziq spoke to his men. A pair of his officers raised their rifles and opened fire, sending the prisoners into spasms on the reddening earth. In the silence that followed, Raziq addressed the crowd, three witnesses said. “You will learn to respect me and reject the Taliban,” \nSimon Harris, the Irish prime minister, linked his government’s decision to Ireland’s quest for in- dependence from Britain. “From our own history, we know what it means: Recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value,” he said at a news briefing. The announcements by all three countries came just days af- ter the International Criminal Court’s  chief  prosecutor  re- quested arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on suspi- cion of war crimes. He also sought warrants for three top leaders of Hamas. \nAbdul Raziq, a critical U.S. partner. \n# \n# \nPalestinian leaders in the West Bank welcomed the recognition by the three countries as an im- portant symbolic gesture. Serious negotiations on a two-state solu- tion have not been held for over a decade. And some observers ar- gue that by not recognizing a Pal- estinian state, the West has en- abled a far-right Israeli agenda opposed to its existence. \nWith the opposition Labour Party ahead in most polls by dou- ble digits for the last 18 months, a Conservative defeat has come to assume an air of inevitability. For all that, Mr. Sunak is calculating that Britain has had just enough good news in recent days — in- cluding glimmers of fresh eco- nomic growth and the lowest infla- tion rate in three years — that his party might be able to cling to power. \n# \n# \nLONDON — Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain on Wednes- day called a snap general election for July 4, throwing the fate of his embattled Conservative Party to a restless British public that ap- pears eager for change after 14 years of Conservative govern- ment. \n# \n# \nOAKLAND, Calif. — When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was consid- ering potential running mates for his presidential run, his shortlist was initially topped by two well- known men with unusual ré- sumés: Aaron Rodgers, the N.F.L. quarterback and frequent purvey- or of conspiracy theories, and Jes- se Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota and professional \nthree people familiar with the events said.

But the Tories have discarded four prime ministers in eight years, lurching through the serial chaos of Brexit, the coronavirus pan- demic and a cost-of-living crisis. \n“We believe it will help preserve the two-state solution and give Palestinians hope that they will have their own state side by side with Israel in peace and security,” Ziad Abu Amr, a senior Palestin- ian official in the West Bank, said in an interview. \nMr. Sunak’s surprise announce- ment,  from  a  rain-spattered lectern in front of 10 Downing Street, was the starting gun for six \n\n“Now is the moment for Britain  Continued on Page A13 \nInstead, Mr. Kennedy made a surprise pick — a woman and a lit- tle-known figure with an unusual background: Nicole Shanahan. Ms. Shanahan, 38, a onetime Sil- icon Valley lawyer, has never held public office and has scant name recognition. But she was selected after Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Ventura fell through as vice-presidential candidates and Mr. Kennedy’s campaign needed money to fund its efforts to get onto state ballots, \n\nMore than 140 countries have recognized Palestinian statehood.

Also known as the Pine Tree flag, it dates back to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the “Stop the Steal” campaign and for a push to \nremake American government in Christian terms. Three photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neigh- bors and passers-by, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Is- land in July and September of 2023. \n# \nLast summer, two years after an upside-down American flag was flown outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., another pro- vocative symbol was displayed at his vacation house in New Jersey, according to interviews and pho- tographs. \n# \nA Google street view image  Continued on Page A19 \nCassie Marckmann, left, with Jeri Pickrell a day after a powerstorm hit Greenfield, Iowa.
