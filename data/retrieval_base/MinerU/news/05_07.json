They flew from Cairo to Kennedy Air- port, where they were greeted with much fanfare by a crowd of about 50 people carrying plush toys, flowers and bobbing bal- loons. \nThis article is by  Vivek Shankar , Liam Stack ,  Adam Rasgon  and  Mi- chael Levenson . \nIsraeli warplanes pounded tar- gets in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Monday as the military told about 110,000 people shelter- ing there to evacuate. Many peo- ple began to leave, fearing that Is- rael was moving ahead with its long-planned invasion, despite stiff international pressure. \nAmong the children was Fadi Alzant, 6, a gaunt boy with pale skin and strawberry blond hair who appeared dazed as the crowd rushed around his wheelchair. An airport employee grew agitated and shouted at people to disperse and to put away their cameras. Fadi, who has cystic fibrosis and weighs about 25 pounds, is suffering from severe malnour- ishment caused by famine, ac- cording to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which coordinated the children’s journeys with as- sistance from the World Health Organization. \nThe Israeli military began drop- ping leaflets in eastern Rafah telling people to move to what it called a humanitarian zone to the north and said it would also notify people by text messages, phone calls and broadcasts in Arabic. A military spokesman would not say when troops might enter the crowded city but described the evacuation as part of Israel’s plans to dismantle Hamas and to free hostages taken on Oct. 7. Hours later, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, issued a statement that the group had ac- cepted a cease-fire proposal from Qatar and Egypt, which have acted as intermediaries in peace talks. The details remained un- clear, but comments by officials of Hamas and Israel quickly made it apparent that Mr. Haniyeh was not referring to the proposal that Israel recently agreed to, leaving the conflict unresolved. \n# \n# \nHe will be treated at Cohen Chil- dren’s Medical Center in Queens.

The order heightens tensions with the West at the start of a week of extensive publicity for Mr. Putin: his inauguration on Tues- day, then the annual Victory Day celebration on Thursday, which commemorates the Soviet victory in World War II. \nPutin Order Heightens Tensions With West Over Ukraine War \n# \nBERLIN — Russia said on Monday that it would hold mili- tary exercises with troops based near Ukraine to practice for the possible use of battlefield nuclear weapons, a provocative warning aimed at discouraging the West from deepening its support for Ukraine. \nThis article is by  Alan Feuer ,  Ben Protess ,  Jonah E. Bromwich  and William K. Rashbaum . \nThe announcement of the exer- cise was Russia’s most explicit warning in its more than two-year invasion of Ukraine that it could use tactical nuclear weapons there. The Kremlin said it came in response to comments by two Eu- ropean leaders that raised the prospect of more direct Western intervention in the war. The exercise, the Defense Min- istry said, will take place “in the near future” and involve forces of the Southern Military District, an area that covers Russian-occu- \n“Let’s not overwhelm them, guys,” someone else said. “Did they get water?” \nThe judge overseeing Donald J. Trump’s criminal trial in Manhat- tan rebuked the former president on Monday for mounting “a direct attack on the rule of law,” holding him in contempt of court for a sec- ond time and threatening to jail him if he continued to break a gag order that bars him from attack- ing jurors. \nIt also coincided with a visit to Europe by President Xi Jinping of China, which has pledged a “no limits” alliance with Russia. China has provided support to Russia’s military industry, U.S. officials say, despite persistent lobbying from the West that it refrain from aiding Russia’s war effort. Asked about Mr. Putin’s order on Monday, John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokes- Continued on Page A11 \nThese weapons, often referred to as “tactical,” are designed for battlefield use and have smaller warheads than the “strategic” nu- clear weapons meant to target cit- ies. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that President Vladimir V. Putin had ordered an exercise for missile, aviation and naval per- sonnel to “increase the readiness of nonstrategic nuclear forces to carry out combat missions.” \nThe Relief Fund, a volunteer- based nonprofit organization that provides free medical care to in- jured and sick children, said the other children’s journeys would end at hospitals in Ohio, Texas and South Carolina. \ntional security spokesman, de- clined to comment on the Hamas response,  saying  the  United States was reviewing it. On Sunday, the talks appeared to reach an impasse, with Israel and Hamas still sharply at odds over the duration of any truce, and each side blaming the other for the failure to strike a deal. Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire,  Continued on Page A8 \nSince the war in the Gaza Strip began after the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed about 1,200 people, more than 34,000 people have died in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Min- istry. \nIn a moment of remarkable courtroom drama, the judge, Juan M.  Merchan,  addressed  Mr. Trump personally from the bench, saying that if there were further violations, he might bypass finan- cial penalties and place the former president behind bars. \nTareq Hailat, who helps oversee the travel efforts for the charity group, said that the children had been chosen based on referrals from hospitals in Gaza or, more commonly, discovered through so- cial media posts about children in need. The group found Fadi, for in- stance, after his mother made a video pleading for help that went viral. The team has evacuated more than 100 children to Egypt, and 60 were then taken to other countries. Seven of them, includ- ing the four who arrived Sunday, have been brought to the United  Continued on Page A9 \n\n\nJustice Merchan acknowledged that jailing Mr. Trump was “the last thing” he wanted to do, but ex- plained that it was his responsibil- ity to “protect the dignity of the justice system.” \nThe judge said that he under- stood “the magnitude of such a de- cision” and that jailing Mr. Trump would be a last resort. He noted: “You are the former president of the United States, and possibly the next president as well.” \nAs the judge delivered his ad- monition and imposed a \\$1,000 fine, Mr. Trump stared straight at him, blinking but not reacting, and when the remarks were over, the former president shook his head. It was the second time in two weeks that Mr. Trump had been punished for breaking the gag or- der, which also bars him from at- tacking prosecutors, witnesses and others. Among the violations of which Mr. Trump has been ac- cused, Justice Merchan has taken those involving the jury most seri- ously. \nGazans who fled Rafah arrived Monday in Khan Younis. \n# \n# \n# \nPARIS — Jordan Bardella, 28, is the new face of the far right in France.
