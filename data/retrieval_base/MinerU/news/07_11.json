While there is no consensus yet about Ukraine joining NATO, the strengthened  language  shows that there is movement in that di- rection. The United States was once  deeply  skeptical  about whether Ukraine was ready to be- come a member, and while ques- tions remain, more and more American and European officials believe that the country will even- tually be able to join. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” members said in a communiqué, \nEvery day that Mr. Biden defies pressure to step aside, the prospects, and logistics, of re- placing him become more unten- able, and riskier. And the poten- tial of weeks of Democratic in- fighting, as a united Republican Party nominates former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump, may start to look worse than rallying be- hind Mr. Biden, no matter the concerns about the 81-year-old president’s health and ability to defeat Mr. Trump. “It’s a mess,” said James \nOver the course of Dr. Tariq’s 12- year career, these stories had be- come more common: The list of treatments that needed pre-ap- proval from insurers seemed ever broadening,  and  the  denials seemed ever rising. \nSo in an effort to spare his pa- tients what he deemed subpar care, and himself mountains of pa- perwork,  Dr.  Tariq  recently turned to an unlikely tool: genera- tive A.I. \nCarville, a consultant who has been among a roster of Demo- crats pushing for Mr. Biden to step aside and clear the way for a new nominee. “Suppose he gets what he wants. Everybody gets exhausted and just says, ‘It’s too much trouble.’” \nFor a growing number of doc- tors, A.I. chatbots — which can draft letters to insurers in seconds — are opening up a new front in the battle to approve costly claims, accomplishing in minutes what years of advocacy and at- tempts at health care reform have not. \n\nMr. Biden’s efforts to dig in were showing signs of initial success. On Tuesday, some Dem- ocratic leaders in Congress ex- pressed support for the president and said it was time to move on. “The urgent need right now is for Democrats to stick together and focus on the danger of Trump and his extremist agenda,” said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado. “If we do that, we will win.” \n“We haven’t had legislative tools or policymaking tools or anything to fight back,” Dr. Tariq said. “This is finally a tool I can use to fight back.” \nThe first Women’s Olympics, top and left, organized by Alice Milliat, right, took place in 1922 in Paris, drawing 77 athletes in track and field. In that era, the Summer Games were overwhelmingly male. This year’s Olympics are expected to be the first with as many female athletes as male ones. \nDoctors are turning to the tech- nology even as some of the coun- try’s largest insurance companies face class-action lawsuits alleging that they used their own technol- ogy to swiftly deny large batches of claims and cut off seriously ill patients from rehabilitation treat- ment. \n# \nThe calendar is on Mr. Biden’s side. In the coming days, atten- tion will turn to Mr. Trump, who is expected to name a running mate before his party gathers next week in Milwaukee to nomi- nate him for a second term. Mr. Biden will be somewhat out of the public spotlight, focusing on the behind-the-scenes campaign to keep nervous Democrats in \nVolodymyr Zelensky visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday. \nThe 1924 Paris Games had a smattering of female athletes — 135 women out of 3,089 competi- tors — but the Olympics hardly welcomed their participation be- yond just a few events, such as swimming and tennis. There were no women’s competitions in most sports, including track and field, soccer, rowing, cycling and even gymnastics. \n# \n# \nSome experts fear that the pri- or-authorization process will soon devolve into an A.I. “arms race,” in which bots battle bots over insur- ance coverage.

On a warm Au- gust day, about 20,000 people came to Pershing Stadium to watch 77 athletes in track and field, including a team from the United States. There was a parade of nations. There were world records. There were 27 journalists and news coverage around the world. \n# \na Century Later \nEvery competitor that day was a woman. “I hereby declare the first fe- male Olympic Games open,” she said. Milliat was making a statement that echoes today. The male- dominated world of the mainline Olympics, busy preparing for the Paris Games of 1924, ignored the 1922 event, other than to complain about Milliat’s unauthorized use of “Olympics.” They dismissed the rising idea that women should compete at all. \n“If you want to see a physician go apoplectic at a cocktail party, mention prior authorizations,” said Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the medicine department at the University of California, San Fran- cisco. \nThere are 35 days between July 18, when Mr. Trump is set to accept his party’s nomination in Milwaukee, and Aug. 22, when Mr. Biden is set to accept his party’s nomination in Chicago.

The official, Amos Hochstein, one of President Biden’s most trusted national security advis- ers, toured the ancient ruins of Baalbek in an area well known as a stronghold of Hezbollah, a U.S.- designated terrorist group spon- sored by Iran. \nSANTA FE, N.M. — Prosecu- tors painted Alec Baldwin as a headstrong actor who repeatedly shirked his duty to maintain gun safety on the set of his film, lead- ing to the shooting death of its cin- ematographer. \nter of it, famous for many movie and TV roles, including “30 Rock” and “Saturday Night Live.” The question of an actor’s liability has weighed over the case since the beginning; SAG-AFTRA, the un- ion representing film and televi- sion workers, has argued that gun safety on sets is the responsibility of qualified professionals, not per- formers. \ntion in Lebanese news media, which wondered how a top Ameri- can official — one born in Israel, no less — was able to move so freely on Hezbollah turf. \nThe trip demonstrated the sur- prising way Mr. Hochstein has be- come one of the few Americans trusted, however grudgingly, by Hezbollah’s leadership. And that trust is crucial today, now that Mr. Biden  has  designated  Mr. Hochstein as his diplomatic point man for preventing clashes across the Israel-Lebanon border from exploding into a war that could be even more devastating than the conflict in Gaza. \nThe defense argued that it was a “tragic accident,” and that Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe that there was live ammunition in his gun, or anywhere on the set of the western “Rust.” \nErlinda O. Johnson, one of the prosecutors, told the jury in her opening statements that Mr. Bald- win should be held criminally re- sponsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins, the “Rust” cinemato- grapher, because he had failed to take part in safety checks that day to see whether his gun contained a live round and because he used the weapon in a reckless fashion. “He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless \nMore than two years and eight months after the gun he was re- hearsing with fired a fatal bullet, Mr. Baldwin found himself in a New  Mexico  courthouse  on Wednesday standing trial on a charge of involuntary manslaugh- ter. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison. \nWearing white pants and a golf shirt, and with no security entou- rage, Mr. Hochstein marveled at the artifacts and snapped photos of the onetime Roman city’s crum- bling stone walls and columns.

The trip caused a minor sensa- \ndisregard for Ms. Hutchins’s safety,” she said in the Santa Fe County District Courthouse. One of Mr. Baldwin’s defense lawyers, Alex Spiro, argued that the actor could not be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter be- cause it was unthinkable for live ammunition to be loaded into a \ngun that was being used as a prop on the set of a movie. He said Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun was “cold,” which he said communicated to the whole production that “there’s nothing in the gun that can hurt anybody.” “Cold guns can’t hurt people,”  Continued on Page A15 \nOfficially, Mr. Hochstein, 51, is Mr. Biden’s top aide for global en- ergy and infrastructure.
