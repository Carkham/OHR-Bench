No. 60,211 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nWEDNESDAY, JULY 10, 2024\n# \nThe Sixth Street Bridge in Los Angeles, known as the “Ribbon of Light,” has been cast into darkness after its wiring was stolen. \n# \n# \nBut He Still Courts, and Needs, Big Backers \nDAY OF ANXIOUS TALKS \n# \nLeaders Emerge Divided but Eager to Move Beyond Turmoil \nWASHINGTON — In a nation- ally broadcast interview on Mon- day, President Biden pushed back on rich Democrats who want him to end his re-election campaign, saying, “I don’t care what the mil- lionaires think.” \nThis article is by  Catie Edmond- son ,  Maya C. Miller ,  Robert Jimison and  Annie Karni . \nSmall donors, he made clear, were coming through for him. \nBut hours later, Mr. Biden joined a private call with his top donors and fund-raisers to re- assure them. “It matters,” he told them of their support. \nWASHINGTON — Top Demo- crats in Congress indicated on Tuesday that they were unwilling — at least for now — to mount an effort to push aside President Bi- den even after a day of meetings in which their members ex- pressed grave concerns about his age, mental acuity and ability to win re-election. \nfacing the president as he grap- ples with the fallout from his dis- astrous  debate  performance against former President Donald J. Trump last month. In order to continue to fund his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden will most likely need the support of wealthy Democratic Party backers, but they have been among the loudest voices calling for him to end his bid for re-election. \nBoth in public and behind closed doors, House and Senate Democrats from across the politi- cal spectrum, including ultra- liberals in safe seats and centrists in politically vulnerable districts, have raised profound fears about Mr. Biden’s viability as a candi- date. But no Democratic leader on Capitol Hill was willing to ask the president to withdraw. \nIn trying to defuse their opposi- tion, Mr. Biden — a politician who has long relied on the party’s es- tablishment to fund his campaign — has adopted a surprisingly pop- ulist anti-elite message that, in some ways, echoes Mr. Trump’s. Major donors are warning that the party will lose the White House and down-ballot races with Mr. Biden atop the ticket. A grow- ing chorus of donors has been pushing — first quietly, then pub- licly — for him to step aside to al- low a replacement nominee and threatening to withhold their cash unless that happens. \n# \nInstead, they emerged on Tues- day swearing allegiance to Mr. Bi- den, if not exactly in enthusiastic or expansive terms. \n# \nThe bottom line: Justice Barrett was the Republican appointee most likely to vote for a liberal re- sult in the last term. \n“I’m with Joe,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the major- ity leader, repeatedly replied, as he sidestepped multiple questions about Mr. Biden’s fitness for office. “We are ridin’ with Biden,” Rep- resentative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina proclaimed nine times as he sought to shut down reporters’ queries. \nJustice in Conservative Bloc Wrote Dissents Joined by Liberals \n# \nWASHINGTON — Justice Amy Coney Barrett, 52, is the youngest member of the Supreme Court and the junior member of its con- servative  supermajority.  Last week, she completed what was only her third full term. \nThat does not make her a liber- al, said Irv Gornstein, the execu- tive director of Georgetown Uni- versity’s Supreme Court Institute. “Don’t forget,” he said, “she voted to overrule Roe v. Wade. She voted to outlaw affirmative action. She almost always votes against the administrative state. And she voted to reject every voting rights challenge.” \n# \nThe Sixth Street Bridge in Los Angeles is wired to glow with col- orful lights celebrating the city’s spirit. But the bridge, known as the “Ribbon of Light,” goes dark at night now. So do stretches of the busy 405 freeway and dozens of street blocks across the city. \nods and conclusions. She wrote notable dissents, joined by liberal justices, from de- cisions limiting the tools prosecu- tors can use in cases against mem- bers of the Jan. 6 mob and block- ing a Biden administration plan to combat air pollution. She voted with the court’s three-member lib- eral wing in March, saying the ma- jority had ruled too broadly in re- storing former President Donald J. Trump to the Colorado ballot. \nYet she has already emerged as a distinctive force on the court, is- suing opinions that her admirers say are characterized by intellec- tual seriousness, independence, caution and a welcome measure of common sense. \nStill, House and Senate Demo- crats left their respective private meetings on Tuesday deeply frac- tured. Asked whether Democrats were on the same page after the discussion, Representative Steve Cohen  of  Tennessee  replied, “We’re not even in the same book.” And on Tuesday afternoon, a seventh House Democrat, Repre- sentative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, publicly called on Mr. Bi- den to withdraw from the race, saying she feared he would be un- able to defeat former President  Continued on Page A17 \nWhile Mr. Biden’s campaign has continued to court wealthy Demo- crats, including working to sched- ule fund-raising receptions de- spite uncertain interest, the presi- dent has also publicly cast the backlash from major donors as a sign that he is sticking up for regu- lar people against moneyed inter- ests. But polls show that many rank-and-file Democratic voters also have deep concerns about his age. \n“Yes,” Professor Gornstein add- ed, “she is more principled and open-minded and thoughtful than some of the others. She cares more about precedent than some  Continued on Page A18 \nIn the term that ended last week, she delivered a series of concurring opinions questioning and honing the majority’s meth- \nAnd in Las Vegas and surround- ing  communities,  more  than 970,000 feet of electrical wiring, the equivalent of 184 miles, have gone missing from streetlights over the past two years. \n# \n“The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Mr. Biden wrote in a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday morning. “Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any se- lected groups of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.” In an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday, Mr. Bi- den said, “I’m getting so frus- trated by the elites,” and he sin- Continued on Page A16 \nThe lights are going out across American cities, as a result of a brazen and opportunistic type of crime. Thieves have been strip- ping copper wire out of thousands of streetlights and selling it to scrap metal recyclers for cash. The wiring typically fetches only a few hundred dollars, but blacked- \n\n\n# \nCats may be the reigning queens of the internet, but sloths are not far behind. \nWith a visage that appears to be smiling and a physiological need to cling, the slow-moving mam- mal, native to Central and South America, has been frequently memed and made into beloved an- imated characters. But lately sloths have been proliferating IRL, far outside their arboreal habitats. They can be fed, cuddled and photographed at animal parks and pet shops, often despite unclear provenance and lax ad- herence to safety and health rules. Sloths join big-eared fennec foxes and baby-faced kinkajous as star attractions in the growing range of venues where interac- tions with animals — the more ex- otic and up-close the better — un- derpin the business model. The number of those U.S.D.A.-licensed exhibitors almost doubled from 2019 to 2021, with over 1,000 sloths inspected annually in the last two years. According to federal data, the risk of animal deaths and dis- ease outbreaks has increased. So have human injuries — and the concerns of experts and state agencies. \nMetal theft has been an urban plague for decades, often rising alongside commodity prices. But the combination of the economic ills and social malaise lingering since the pandemic and soaring demand for metals, especially for copper, has brought this street crime to new levels. \nSTAUNCH SUPPORT  Black women are dismissing calls for President Biden to step aside.

Across Los Angeles County, more than 290 fire hydrants have gone missing since January. \n# \nAnd in Denver, two men were arrested this winter for removing bronze artwork from a Martin Lu- ther King Jr. monument, causing roughly   $\\S85{,}000$   in damage. The police said the two men were paid \\$394 for the metal, which was re- covered from a local scrap com- pany. \nJERUSALEM — A new prob- lem is bedeviling humanitarian aid convoys attempting to deliver relief to hungry Gazans: attacks by organized crowds seeking not the flour and medicine that trucks are carrying, but cigarettes smug- gled inside the shipments. \nscan everything that goes in and out of Gaza through Israeli-ad- ministered checkpoints.

U.N. and Israeli officials say the coordinated at- tacks by groups seeking to sell smuggled cigarettes for profit pose a formidable obstacle to bringing desperately needed aid to southern Gaza. The Israeli authorities closely \noften wind up, by design, on social media. That visibility normalizes hugging critters — but many ani- mal experts say it shouldn’t. Research shows that depicting interactions can mislead the pub- lic into thinking the animals could be pets, or question whether they’re really endangered. “Put simply, viewing animals in contact with people has the potential to in- \nOther theft hits personally.
