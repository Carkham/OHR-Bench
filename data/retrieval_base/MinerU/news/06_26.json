No. 60,197 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 26, 2024\n# \n# \nA tear-gas canister exploded in Nairobi on Tuesday as Kenyans tried to help the wounded during a protest against tax increases. \nParliament Is Breached After Increase Passes \nA BLOW TO NETANYAHU \n# \nTop Court’s 9-0 Decision Could Break Up His Coalition Cabinet \nNAIROBI, Kenya — Thousands of demonstrators flooded the streets of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, and some broke into Parliament and briefly set fire to the entrance on Tuesday, after lawmakers ap- proved tax increases that critics said would drive up the cost of liv- \n# \nJERUSALEM — Israel’s Su- preme Court ruled on Tuesday that the military must begin draft- ing ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, a decision that threatened to split Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- yahu’s coalition government amid the war in Gaza. \nDuring the protests, the police fired tear gas and guns, plunging the capital into turmoil. At least five people were fatally shot and 31 others wounded, according to Amnesty International and sev- eral prominent Kenyan civic orga- nizations. The toll could not be im- mediately confirmed. The inde- pendent Kenya Human Rights Commission posted a video that showed police officers firing as protesters marched toward them. As tear gas wafted through the streets, some protesters climbed through the windows of Parlia- ment after lawmakers voted 195 to 106 in favor of the tax bill on Tues- day, with supporters saying it would raise revenue for education and other essential services. Kenya’s  president,  William Ruto, said he was deploying the military to crack down on what he called “treasonous events.” In a televised address on Tuesday night, Mr. Ruto said the debate about the tax bill had been “hi- jacked by dangerous people who have caused us the kind of loss we have incurred as a nation today.” He vowed to punish those he said were responsible. “It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peace- ful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives and the institu- tions established under our Con- stitution and expect to go scot- free,” Mr. Ruto added. The defense minister, Aden Duale, said the defense forces had been deployed to support the po- lice, who he said were responding to  the  “security  emergency” caused by the protests, which spread to other Kenyan cities. The turmoil over the finance bill has shaken Kenya, an East Afri- can economic powerhouse of 54 million people that has long been an anchor of stability in a tumul- tuous region. Last week, at least one person was killed and 200 oth- ers wounded in protests across the country, according to Amnesty International. The protests convulsed Kenya just as 400 Kenyan police officers \nIn a unanimous decision, a pan- el of nine judges held that there was no legal basis for the long- standing military exemption giv- en to ultra-Orthodox religious stu- dents. Without a law distinguish- ing between seminarians and other men of draft age, the court ruled, the country’s mandatory draft laws must similarly apply to the ultra-Orthodox minority. In a country where military service is compulsory for most Jewish Israelis, both men and women, the exemption for the ul- tra-Orthodox has long prompted resentment. But anger over the group’s special treatment has grown as the war in Gaza has stretched into its ninth month, re- quiring tens of thousands of re- servists to serve multiple tours and costing the lives of hundreds of soldiers. “These days, in the midst of a difficult war, the burden of that in- equality is more acute than ever — and requires the advancement of a sustainable solution to this is- sue,” the Supreme Court said in its \n# \n# \n# \nShe would not donate to him while Nikki Haley, his last rival standing and a friend of hers, re- mained in the race, according to two people briefed on the meeting who insisted on anonymity to de- scribe a private gathering.

Trump and several top aides gathered for a quick dinner in a suite atop his ho- tel in Las Vegas before he de- scended and declared victory. But the Republican billionaire at the center of attention during the meal was not Mr. Trump — it was Dr. Miriam Adelson. The former president, by then on a glide path to the Republican \nDeaths Are Mounting at Major Global Events \nnomination, wanted financial sup- port from Dr. Adelson, a conserva- tive megadonor, and she had a re- quest or two. Be less bombastic, she told him, and speak more di- rectly about the economy. But more important, she made clear to Mr. Trump and his top aides, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, be pa- tient. \n# \nSYDNEY, Australia — At large events all over the world, the scenes of extreme heat stress are starting to look familiar. Older men, shirts undone, lying down with their eyes closed. Aid tents packed with the unconscious. And lines of the faithful — whether they seek religion, mu- sic, ballot boxes or sport — sweating under slivers of shade. The consequences have been dire. At this year’s hajj, the Is- lamic pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, at least 1,300 people died as temperatures surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. And in many ways, that heavy toll was just the latest sign that crowd control and heat waves fueled by climate change are on a dangerous colli- sion course. \nIt would have been uncouth that Continued on Page A15 \nThe decision threatened to wid- en one of the most painful divi- sions in Israeli society, pitting sec- ular Jews against the ultra-Ortho- dox, who say their religious study is as essential and protective as the military.

The drugs have helped some of them lose 15 to 20 percent of their weight. But most people in the area she serves don’t have insur- ance that covers the cost, and vir- tually no one can afford sticker prices of \\$1,000 to \\$1,400 a month. “Even my richest patients can’t afford it,” Dr. Bailey said.
