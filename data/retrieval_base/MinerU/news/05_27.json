Each sheet was further broken down by unit, with names, phone numbers and other infor- mation on the residents. \n# \nPerhaps the most important de- tail, though, was how each unit was color-coded. Green meant trustworthy. Yellow, needing at- tention. Orange required “strict control.” \nBERLIN — Periodic outcries over incompetence and corrup- tion at the top of the Russian mili- tary have dogged President Vladi- mir V . Putin’s war effort since the start of his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. \nA police officer inspected the wall. Then he leaned forward to mark a third-floor apartment in yellow. The residents in that unit changed often, and therefore were “high risk,” his note said. He would follow up on them later. “I’ve built a system to address hidden dangers in my jurisdic- tion,” the officer said, in a video by the local government that praised his work as a model of innovative policing. \nWhen his forces faltered around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the need for change was laid bare. When they were routed months later outside the city of Kharkiv, expectations of a shake-up grew. And after the mercenary leader Yevgeny V . Prigozhin marched his men toward Moscow, complaining of deep rot and ineptitude at the top of the Russian force, Mr. Putin seemed obliged to respond. But, at each turn, the Russian president avoided any major pub- \nThis is the kind of local govern- ance that China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, wants: more visible, more invasive, always on the look- out for real or perceived threats.

Walking to synagogue in Safed, a hill town above the Sea of Galilee known for centuries as a center of kabbalah, or ancient Jewish mys- ticism, he said he still didn’t feel great about the gun. \nThe Chinese Communist Party has long wielded perhaps the world’s most sweeping surveil- lance apparatus against activists and others who might possibly voice discontent. Then, during the coronavirus pandemic, the sur- veillance reached an unprece- dented scale, tracking virtually every urban resident in the name of preventing infections. \nIn Safed, as in the rest of Israel, people fear a repeat of Oct. 7, when gunmen with Hamas crossed from Gaza into Israel and killed 1,200 people in rural villages, army bases and cities, according to Israeli authorities. The police and the military were slow to re- spond that day. In many commu- nities, the only ones fighting back were volunteers with rapid re- sponse teams that are known in Israel as Kitat Konenut. \n# \nIn late 2022, as thousands of mi- grants began to arrive in New York City, city officials scrambled to find places to house them. They quickly found takers: hotels that were still struggling to recover from the pandemic-driven down- turn in tourism. \n“I feel like it’s very — artificial,” he said, struggling to find the right word in English, looking down at the gun. “It’s not human. It’s not life.” \nPresident Vladimir Putin and ex-minister Sergei K. Shoigu. \nAt the synagogue, men with graying beards and black suits — all fellow members of the Chabad movement,  an  ultra-Orthodox sect of Judaism — slapped Mr. Ben-Ari on the back. They were happy to see him. Happy to see his gun. It was the only one there, but far from unique.

Now, with the battlefield crises seemingly behind him and Mr. Prigozhin  dead,  the  Russian leader has decided to act, chang- ing defense ministers for the first time in more than a decade and al- Continued on Page A6 \nSleeping with the rifle under his pillow, he worried about it being stolen. After his 13-year-old son came home with a toy replica, Mr. Ben-Ari considered returning the real thing, doubting his decision to join the newly formed civilian mi- litia that had given him the weap- on. \nDozens of hotels, from once- grand facilities to more modest es- tablishments, closed to tourists and began exclusively sheltering migrants, striking multimillion- dollar deals with the city. The hu- manitarian crisis became the ho- tel industry’s unexpected lifeline in New York; the hotels became a safe haven for tens of thousands of asylum seekers. \nNow, it is clear that Mr. Xi wants to make that expanded control permanent, and to push it even further. \nBefore the attack, much of Sa- fed didn’t think it needed such a group. For decades, this city of 40,000 has drawn the very reli- Continued on Page A10 \nThe goal is no longer just to ad- dress specific threats, such as the virus or dissidents. It is to embed the party so deeply in daily life that no trouble, no matter how seemingly minor or apolitical, can even arise. \nEyal Ben-Ari carrying his personal weapon at home in Safed, Israel, near the Lebanon border. \nTwo years in, as the city’s peak tourism season is about to begin, the migrant crisis has helped dra- matically shift the hotel landscape in New York. The conversion of hotels to shelters has sharply de- creased the supply of rooms just as tourist demand has risen, nearly to prepandemic levels, and is projected to match a record high. \nMr. Xi has branded this effort the “Fengqiao experience for a new era.” The Beijing suburb in the propaganda video, Zhangji- awan, was recently recognized in state media as a national exem- plar of the approach. \nRUSSIAN JAMMING  Some U.S. weapons are said to be vulnerable to electronic warfare.

The coun- try’s new airports, diplomatic prestige and booming stock mar- kets may look like Mr. Modi’s call- ing card, but for the 95 percent of Indians who earn too little to file income taxes, small infusions of cash and household goods matter more. And Mr. Modi’s party is or- ganized to make the most of them in the national election that ends early next month. \n# \n“You get installments of 2,000 rupees, right?” asked a local offi- cial from Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Ja- nata Party, or B.J.P .
