In the month since it was at- tached to the shoreline, the pier has been in service only about 10 days. The rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused be- cause of security concerns. \nThis article is by  Zolan Kanno- Youngs ,  Miriam Jordan ,  Jazmine Ulloa  and  Hamed Aleaziz . \nreaching new protections for hun- dreds of thousands of immigrants who have been living in the United States illegally for years but are married to American citizens. Under the new policy, some  $500{,}000$   undocumented spouses will be shielded from deportation and given a pathway to citizen- ship and the ability to work legally in the United States. It is one of the most expansive actions to protect immigrants since Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was enacted 12 years ago to pro- tect those who came to the United States as children. \nThe pier was never meant to be more than a stopgap measure while the Biden administration pushed Israel to allow more food and other supplies into Gaza through land routes, a far more ef- ficient way to deliver relief. But even the modest goals for the pier are likely to fall short, some Amer- ican military officials say. \n# \nSome parents in states like Georgia are turning to private schools with a half-dozen or so students, with taxpayers’ help.

In recent weeks, Is- rael has given relief organizations greater access, but the groups say the situation remains dire. \n“These couples have been rais- ing families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, where he was joined by members of Congress and DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. “They’re liv- ing in the United States all this time with fear and uncertainty. We can fix that.” \n# \n# \nTrump, on economic issues. Often, they indicate that only relatively small slices of the electorate be- lieve Mr. Biden’s policies have helped them or their family finan- cially. \nThe Biden administration ini- tially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month, a looming deadline that officials say they hope will pressure Israel to open more ground routes. \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — The \\$1.9 tril- lion economic stimulus package that  President  Biden  signed \nMr. Biden also said he would make it easier for young immi- grants, including Dreamers, to gain access to work visas, a signif- icant move that could help them eventually get a green card. That would protect their legal status even if DACA, which is already tied up in litigation, disappears. “We’re a much better and stronger  nation  because  of Dreamers,” Mr. Biden said, as he marked the anniversary of the Obama-era DACA program. The new policy allows Mr. Bi- den to balance his recent crack- down on asylum with a sweeping pro-immigrant measure at a mo- ment of political peril. With five months until the presidential elec- tion, Mr. Biden has been trying to curtail record numbers of illegal border crossings without alienat- ing longtime supporters who have called for a more humane immi- gration system after the Trump years. \nAt the same time, though, the stimulus may be lifting Mr. Bi- den’s chances for November in ways that pollsters rarely ask about. \n# \ncome both an anchor and a buoy for his re-election campaign. The American Rescue Plan, which the Biden administration created and Democrats passed in March 2021, has fueled discontent among voters, in sometimes para- doxical ways. Some Americans blame the law, which included di- rect checks to individuals, for helping to fuel rapid inflation. Others appear upset that its re- lief to people, businesses and \nschool districts was short-lived. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las reported recently that several business contacts in its district “expressed concern about the winding down of American Res- cue Plan Act dollars and whether nonprofits and K-12 schools will be able to sustain certain programs without that funding.” Polls show that Americans con- tinue to favor Mr. Biden’s oppo- nent, former President Donald J. \nJERUSALEM — As the war has raged in Gaza, another battle has unfurled in parallel along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon — a risky game of tit-for-tat that has intensified in recent weeks, with a far stronger foe. \nEconomists say the relief pack- age, along with stimulus meas- ures Mr. Trump signed into law in 2020, has helped accelerate Amer- ica’s recovery from the pandemic recession. The United States has grown and added jobs in a way that no other wealthy nation has experienced after the pandemic. Continued on Page A16 \nPresident Biden ordered the U.S. military to begin building the pier in March, at a time when he was being sharply criticized for not doing more to rein in Israel’s military response to the Oct. 7 Ha- mas-led attacks. \nIn a measure of the danger of a full-scale war erupting, President Biden dispatched one of his senior aides, Amos Hochstein, to Israel on Monday and to Lebanon on Tuesday to press for a diplomatic solution. \nThe first truckloads of aid be- gan moving ashore on May 17.

Despite apparent efforts by both sides to keep the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes from spiraling into a full-blown war be- yond the one raging in Gaza, civil- ians in Israel and Lebanon have been killed, and more than 150,000 people have been forced from their homes along the border.
