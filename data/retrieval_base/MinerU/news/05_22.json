The United States had become the world’s leading exporter of natural gas, and no other country in history was pumping more crude. The in- dustry was enjoying record prof- its. \n# \nJERUSALEM — If the head- lines in Israel were anything to go by, the request by the Interna- tional Criminal Court’s chief pros- ecutor for an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  seemed  to  have granted the Israeli leader one of the most fortuitous turnarounds in his long and turbulent political career. \nThen, in January, Mr. Biden paused new permits for export fa- cilities for liquefied natural gas. That decision galvanized oil and gas companies against Mr. Biden, according to industry lobbyists, and will be an undercurrent at a fund-raising lunch set for Wednes- day in Houston. The luncheon, or- ganized by three oil executives, will benefit former President Don- ald J. Trump, who is running to un- seat Mr. Biden and is expected to attend, according to several peo- ple who have seen the invitation. To the industry, Mr. Biden’s pause on new gas export permits “was a wake-up call,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which supports the fossil fuel industry. “He could be potentially icing billions of dol- lars in long-term L.N.G. contracts. That’s real. That’s tangible.” \n“The Hypocrisy of The Hague,” blared Tuesday’s front page of Ye- diot Ahronot, a popular main- stream daily that has often been critical of Mr. Netanyahu. \nEchoing the outrage expressed by Israelis across the political spectrum, and abandoning any semblance of impartiality, the front page denounced “the intoler- able gall” of the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, for what it described as putting Israel alongside the leaders of Hamas who “seek to an- nihilate it.” \n# \n# \nUtah and Washington. Even in the Northeast, where homeowners in- surance was still generally prof- itable last year, the trends are worsening. \nWith Climate Disasters Increasing, Coverage Is Tougher to Get \n# \nThe threat of arrest warrants comes against Mr. Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gal- lant, as well as three leaders of Ha- mas, on charges of war crimes from the devastating Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and Is- rael’s punishing retaliatory cam- paign in Gaza. \nAt first glance, Dave Langston’s predicament seems similar to headaches facing homeowners in coastal states vulnerable to cata- strophic hurricanes: As disasters became more frequent and se- vere, his insurance company had been losing money. Then, it can- celed his coverage and left the state. \nIn 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners  coverage  in  18 states, more than a third of the country, according to a New York Times analysis of newly available financial data. That’s up from 12 states five years ago, and eight states in 2013. The result is that in- surance companies are raising premiums by as much as 50 per- cent or more, cutting back on cov- erage or leaving entire states alto- gether. Nationally, over the last decade, insurers paid out more in claims than they received in pre- miums, according to the ratings  \n# \nThey have a stranglehold on the country’s infrastructure, from po- lice stations to seaports. They have chased hundreds of thou- sands of people from the capital. And they are suspected of having ties to the 2021 assassination of Haiti’s president. \nsure the townhouses, on a quiet cul-de-sac at the edge of Cedar Rapids, that belong to members of his  homeowners  association. Without coverage, “if we were to have damage that hit all 17 units, we’re looking at bankruptcy for all of us,” he said. \nOne of the luncheon hosts is the billionaire Kelcy Lee Warren, who, as executive chairman of En- ergy Transfer, has built a national network of pipelines, including those serving L.N.G. export facili- ties. His Dallas-based company, which exports oil and gas prod- ucts to about 50 countries, tangled with the Biden administration last year when it refused to extend a permit for a proposed export ter- minal that had run into delays. An indefinite pause on new permits complicates plans by Energy Transfer to continue an interna- tional expansion. \nIt appeared to broadly galva- nize Mr. Netanyahu’s opposition in his favor. Political rivals in Is- rael offered support. American of- ficials, who had been critical of his plan to invade Rafah, roundly con- demned the I.C.C. action. In the hours and days before, Mr. Netanyahu had appeared em- battled, both domestically and in- ternationally. \nBut Mr. Langston lives in Iowa. Relatively consistent weather once made Iowa a good bet for in- surance companies. But now, as a warming planet makes events like hail and wind storms worse, insur- ers are fleeing. \nWestern diplomats and officials say the influence and capability of many Haitian gangs are evolving, making them ever more threat- ening to the Kenyan-led multi- national police force soon deploy- ing to Haiti as well as the fragile transitional council trying to set a path for elections. \nThe insurance turmoil caused by climate change — which had been concentrated in Florida, Cal- ifornia and Louisiana — is fast be- coming a contagion, spreading to states like Iowa, Arkansas, Ohio, \nMr. Langston spent months try- ing to find another company to in- \nThe Israeli public had become increasingly frustrated with the government’s failure, over seven months, to achieve its stated war goals of eliminating Hamas and bringing home the 128 hostages who remain in Gaza, alive and dead. Mr. Netanyahu’s emergency war cabinet was on the brink of falling apart. \nContinued on Page A12 \n\nWith their arrival just days away, the 2,500 police officers will confront  a  better  equipped, funded, trained and unified gang force than any mission previously deployed to the Caribbean nation, security experts say. \nAnother host, Harold G. Hamm, the  executive  chairman  and founder of Continental Resources, is one of the pioneers of the shale oil boom that turned the United States into the world’s largest crude exporter. Also expected to join is Vicki Hollub, the chief exec- utive of Occidental Petroleum, one of the top U.S. oil producers. \nTwo key war cabinet members, Mr. Gallant and Benny Gantz, a former military chief, had publicly excoriated Mr. Netanyahu in re- cent days for failing to develop a plan for governing postwar Gaza. Mr. Gantz had even issued an ulti- matum, saying his centrist party would quit the government if Mr. Netanyahu did not come up with a clear strategy by June 8. \nmoney, some gangs have found in- dependent financial lifelines since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 and the col- lapse of the state that ensued. “The gangs had been making their money from kidnappings and extortion and from payouts from politicians during elections and the business elites in be- tween,” said William O’Neill, the United Nations-appointed human  Continued on Page A6 \nThe private luncheon to benefit MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, comes about a month after Mr. Trump hosted energy execu- tives over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida.

Students have been required for decades to learn to solve for the variable x, and to find the slope of a line. Most complete the course in their first year of high school. But top-achievers are sometimes allowed to enroll earli- er, typically in eighth grade. The dual pathways inspire some of the most fiery debates over equity and academic oppor- \nfast track? Should middle schools eliminate algebra to level the play- ing field? What if standout pupils lose the chance to challenge them- selves? \n# \nThe questions are so fraught be- cause algebra functions as a cru- cial crossroads in the education system. \n“Nearly every single grand- child of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden,” Ms. Kennedy said as her siblings, and Mr. Bi- den, flanked her onstage. “That’s right: The Kennedy family en- dorses Joe Biden for president.” That was not the first time that Ms. Kennedy, the seventh child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, had been the face of the family’s push- back against her brother.

Those who take it early can take calculus by 12th grade, giving them a potential edge when applying to elite uni- versities and lifting them toward society’s most high-status and lu- crative professions. \nTo a large extent, Ms. Ken- nedy’s siblings say, her outsize role is an outgrowth of the affec- tion she has displayed toward her brother since they were children playing on the grounds of the fam- ily estate in Hickory Hill, Va. —  Continued on Page A16 \nKennedy has emerged as a skep- tic of Covid-19 vaccines and a pur- veyor of conspiratorial theories on the assassination of his father, it has fallen to Ms. Kennedy to dis- tance her family from the brother \nBut racial and economic gaps in  Continued on Page A22 \nDo bias and inequality keep Black and Latino children off the \n\n# \n# \n\n\nFinding Their Own Answers Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons and Willem Dafoe, stars of Yorgos Lanthimos’s new film, “Kinds of Kindness,” say that when working with the director, the less you know, the better.
