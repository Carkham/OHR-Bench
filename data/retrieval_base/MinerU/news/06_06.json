Trump are calling for revenge prosecutions and other retalia- tory measures against Democrats in response to his felony convic- tion in New York. \n# \nALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced on Wednesday that she was shelv- ing the long-awaited tolling plan known as congestion pricing, just weeks before it was to go into ef- fect. \nWithin hours of a jury finding Mr. Trump guilty last week, the anger congealed into demands for action. Since then, prominent G.O.P . leaders in and out of gov- ernment have demanded that elected Republicans use every available instrument of power against Democrats, including tar- geted investigations and prosecu- \nhave come to the difficult decision that implementing the planned congestion pricing system risks too many unintended conse- quences,” Ms. Hochul said, add- ing, “I have directed the M.T.A. to indefinitely pause the program.” The  move  angered  envi- ronmentalists, transit advocates and economists, with some accus- ing the governor of abandoning a plan that was decades in the mak- ing for political reasons in a criti- cal election year. \nThe intensity of anger and open desire for using the criminal jus- tice system against Democrats af- ter the verdict surpasses anything seen before in Mr. Trump’s tumul- tuous years in national politics. What is different now is the range of Republicans who are saying re- taliation is necessary and who are no longer cloaking their intent with euphemisms. \nThe decision, Ms. Hochul ac- knowledged, was not an easy one, but she said it was nonetheless crucial in light of the lingering ef- fects of the coronavirus pandemic on working families and New York City’s economy. \nStephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Mr. Trump who still helps guide his thinking on policy, blared out a directive on Fox News after a jury found Mr. Trump guilty of falsifying finan- cial records to cover up a 2016 campaign hush-money payment to a porn actress. Mr. Miller posed a series of questions to Republi- cans at every level, including local district attorneys. \n# \n# \ning of D-Day as the first Allied planes and gliders were arriving in Normandy. One of the members of that elite French unit, Émile Bouétard, was shot dead by sol- diers with the German army. He is considered among the first Allied casualties of D-Day. \nThe congestion pricing plan, the first of its kind in the nation, was slated to start June 30. Drivers us- ing E-ZPass would have paid as much as \\$15 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. \n# \n# \nBRITTANY, France — Some 170 miles southwest of the cele- brated landing beaches in Nor- mandy, the remains of a D-Day site few visit peek out from behind trees in rural Brittany. \nEffort to Shape Opinion on the War in Gaza \nThe governor said she feared that instituting a toll to drive into the borough would “create an- other obstacle to our economic re- covery.” \n“The bravery and determina- tion of these united fighters played a major role in the libera- tion of our country,” Mr. Macron said before the crowd gathered, braving intermittent rain spells typical of the region. “Their heroic actions leave an indelible mark on our history.” \nwas discovered by the Nazis and destroyed. Dozens of fighters were hunted down and killed. In retribution, most buildings in the surrounding area were burned and hundreds of locals were exe- cuted. It’s a wound of tragic heroism that few in France know about, let alone commemorate. President Emmanuel Macron of France aimed to change that when he presided over a ceremo- ny on Wednesday in Plumelec, the nearby village where French com- mandos landed early in the morn- \nOvergrown with moss and ivy, the stone farm buildings were the former headquarters of the Saint- Marcel Maquis — thousands of lo- cal French resistance fighters who had gathered in response to coded Allied calls over BBC radio to prepare for an invasion. Among them were French army comman- dos parachuted in to block the Na- zis from sending reinforcements to the beaches. \n# \nTEL AVIV — Israel organized and paid for an influence cam- paign last year targeting U.S. law- makers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging, as it aimed to foster support for its ac- tions in the war with Gaza, accord- ing to officials involved in the ef- fort and documents related to the operation. \n“Let’s be real: A \\$15 charge may not seem like a lot to someone who has the means, but it can break the budget of a hard-working middle- class household,” Ms. Hochul said. In the days before her an- nouncement, the governor noti- fied the White House and the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jef- fries, of her plans, according to two people familiar with the con- Continued on Page A23 \n“Every facet of Republican Party politics and power has to be used right now to go toe to toe with Marxism and beat these Commu- nists,” Mr. Miller said, using the catchall slurs Trump allies rou- tinely use against Democrats. Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to Mr. Trump, said  \nThe president’s visit — and ac- companying history lesson — was the latest in a year of events planned to celebrate the country’s release from the Nazis’ grip 80 years ago. Unlike many of his  Continued on Page A6 \nThe covert campaign was com- missioned by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, a government body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The min- istry allocated about \\$2 million to the operation and hired Stoic, a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents. The campaign began in October and remains active on the plat- form X. At its peak, it used hun- dreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on U.S. lawmakers, particularly ones who are Black and Demo- crats, such as Representative Ha- keem Jeffries, the House minority leader from New York, and Sena- tor Raphael Warnock of Georgia, with posts urging them to contin- ue funding Israel’s military. \nBut before the operation could be put into full swing, the camp \n# \n\n# \nSan Diego is a top entry point for the first time in 25 years. \nThe recent surge in San Diego has been overwhelming enough that a government-funded wel- come center exhausted its budget and had to close in February. Since then, the United States Bor- der Patrol has bused migrants to a trolley center and sent them on their way. \n# \nSAN DIEGO — From sunrise to sunset, the U.S. Border Patrol buses arrived every hour at a sun- baked parking lot in San Diego. Dozens of migrants stepped outside each time, many seeming to be confused about what was happening at this trolley hub on a recent weekend. There were no lo- cal officials to answer questions. No services. And few ways to reach their next destination in the United States. \nMany have been turned away from crowded migrant shelters nearby. Dozens have ended up at the San Diego International Air- port, where they have camped out at baggage claim for days at a time as they waited for flights to other destinations. \nFor the first time in 25 years, the San Diego region has become a top destination for migrants along the southern United States border, surpassing the number of illegal crossings at areas in Arizona and Texas for several weeks this year, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \nChatGPT, the artificial intelli- gence-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites fea- turing pro-Israel articles. \nNonprofit organizations have tried to fill the void by providing aid and transportation advice to migrants. But volunteers de- scribed a predicament for which  Continued on Page A20 \nIt has been a surprising turn for a border spot that was the focal point of the bitter national debate over immigration decades ago, before falling out of the spotlight as migrant flows shifted east- \nThe Israeli government’s con- nection to the influence operation, which The New York Times veri- fied with four current and former members of the Ministry of Dias- pora Affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March. Last week, Meta, which owns Face- book and Instagram, and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. \n# \nThe United States, Britain, Can- ada, Australia and New Zealand — an intelligence-sharing part- nership known as the Five Eyes — said in a bulletin that China’s Peo- ple’s Liberation Army was trying to tap the “skills and expertise of these individuals” to improve its own air operations. \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — For years, U.S. officials have accused China of stealing American technology to design and build fighter planes. But while China learned how to build advanced fighters, its pilots could not fly them so well. That may be starting to change, according to American officials. \nU.S. and allied intelligence offi- cials warned on Wednesday that Beijing was intensifying a cam- paign to entice former fighter pi- lots from Western nations to train Chinese pilots. \nThe secretive campaign signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on  Continued on Page A10 \n# \n“To overcome their shortcom- ings, China’s People’s Liberation  Continued on Page A9 \nTwo NASA astronauts headed to orbit Wednesday in a craft built by Boeing, a long-delayed win for the aerospace giant.
