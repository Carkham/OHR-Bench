One conse- quence of this polarization, poli- ticians and pundits often say, is gridlock in Washington. But in a country that is sup- posed to have a gridlocked fed- eralgovernment,thepastfour years are hard to explain. These years have been arguably the most productive period of Wash- ington bipartisanship in decades. During the Covid pandemic, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together to pass emergency responses. Under President Biden, bipartisan majorities have passed major laws on infrastructure and semi- conductor chips, as well as laws on veterans' health, gun violence, the Postal Service,theaviation system, same-sex marriage, anti-Asian hate crimes and the electoral process. On trade, the Biden administration has kept some of the Trump administra- tion's signature policies and even expanded them. The trend has continued over the past month, first with the passage of a bipartisan bill to aid Ukraine and other allies and to force a sale of Tik Tok by its Chi nese owner. After the bill's pas- sage, far-right House Republi- can s tried to oust Speaker Mike Johnson because he did not block it — and House Democrats voted to save his job.
