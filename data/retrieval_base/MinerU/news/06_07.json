Gazan health officials said dozens of peo- ple were killed, including women and children. \nThe strike was the latest in a deadly surge of fighting in central Gaza, where Israeli forces have announced an offensive against what they describe as a renewed insurgency by Hamas. \nThe strike hit a compound that had been operated by UNRWA, the main U.N. body that aids Pal- estinians in Gaza. About 6,000 dis- placed Palestinians were shelter- ing in the complex, in the central Gaza area of Nuseirat, when it was struck, said Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokeswoman. \nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets had targeted three classrooms in the school building that held 20 to 30 Palestinian mili- tants affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small- er militia that, like Hamas, is backed by Iran. Israeli forces had twice postponed the strike to re- duce civilian casualties, the mili- tary said. \n# \n# \noratory and none have matched it at Normandy since. But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Biden wants to use the inspiring story of the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc to make a case for American alli- ances in the face of Russian aggression — and, implicitly, for himself. \n# \n# \nThe precise toll could not be verified. The Gaza Health Min- istry said that of the roughly 40 people killed in the attack, 14 were children and nine were women. Later, The Associated Press re- ported different numbers, saying at least 33 people died, including three women and nine children, citing the hospital morgue. \nPARIS — The aging American president facing a re-election campaign came to the Normandy coast of France to pay tribute to the daring Army Rangers who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, offer a paean to democracy for which they sacrificed and per- haps even wrap himself a little bit in their reflected glory. That was 1984, and the presi- dent was Ronald Reagan, who delivered an ode to heroism and patriotism that would become one of the most iconic moments \nof his presidency. Forty years later, another aging president facing re-election plans to return to the same spot Friday to honor the same heroes and effectively align himself with Mr. Reagan’s legacy of leadership against tyranny. \nThis article is by  Glenn Thrush , Eileen Sullivan  and  Zach Monta- gue . \n# \nSDE TEIMAN, Israel — The men sat in rows, handcuffed and blindfolded, unable to see the Is- raeli soldiers who stood watch over them from the other side of a mesh fence. \nIf there is something auda- cious about Mr. Biden, a staunch Democrat who was no friend of Mr. Reagan’s in the 1980s, sum- moning the spirit of the Republi- can legend, it speaks to the up-is- down, black-is-white nature of politics in today’s America.

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said he was “not aware of any civilian casu- alties” resulting from the strike. “We conducted a precise strike against the terrorists where they were,” he said. He said the mili- tants had used the compound to plan attacks on Israeli forces, al- though he did not provide specific examples. \nMs. Biden, 50, is by far the most important witness for the govern- ment. She is one of the few able to offer a detailed, and intimate, ac- counting of Mr. Biden’s all-con- suming addiction to crack co- caine.

The testimony was intended to nail down a clear prosecutorial timeline, which Mr. Biden’s law- yers later undermined.
