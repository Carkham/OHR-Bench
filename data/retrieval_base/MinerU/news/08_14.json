Mr. Netanyahu has con- sistently placed all blame for the deadlocked negotiations on Ha- mas, even as senior members of the Israeli security establishment accused him of slowing the process himself. \n# \nArizona voters will decide in November whether to establish a right to abortion in the state con- stitution, a measure that could strongly influence turnout in a battleground state crucial to the presidential election and control of the Senate. \nBut in private, Mr. Netanyahu has, in fact, added new conditions to Israel’s demands, additions that his own negotiators fear have cre- ated extra obstacles to a deal. Ac- cording to unpublished docu- ments reviewed by The New York Times that detail Israel’s negotiat- ing positions, Israel relayed a list of new stipulations in late July to American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that added less flexible conditions to a set of principles it had made in late May. \nThe  Arizona  Secretary  of State’s office said it had certified 577,971 signatures collected by a coalition  of  abortion  rights groups, 50 percent more than re- quired to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot in No- vember. It is the largest number of certified signatures for any ballot measure in state history. \nA similar question will appear on the ballot in Missouri, after the Secretary of State there said on Tuesday that abortion rights groups had collected 254,871 valid signatures, more than enough to place the measure on the ballot. Missouri, the first state to enact an abortion ban after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, could become the first state where a citi- zen-sponsored  measure  over- turns a near-total ban. \nDoubts have also been raised about Hamas’s willingness to compromise on key issues, and the group requested its own ex- tensive revisions throughout the process, while ceding some small- er points in July. On Tuesday, Ah- mad Abdul-Hadi, a Hamas official, said the group would not be par- ticipating in a new round of nego- tiations set to take place in Doha, Qatar, or Cairo on Thursday. \n# \n# \nRussian oil refineries and airfields with a fleet of homemade drones. Two smaller, earlier forays into Russia by Russian exile groups backed by the Ukrainian Army ended in quick retreats. But until last week, Ukraine forces had not counterattacked into Russia. \n# \n# \nSUDZHA, Russia — All that re- mained of a Russian border post was a tableau of destruction: Sheet metal flapped in the wind, customs declarations fluttered about, and stray dogs roamed un- der a road-spanning sign that said, “Russia.” \n# \nThousands of demonstrators are expected in the streets and the parks of Chicago for next week’s Democratic National Convention, most of them to protest the U.S. role in the war in Gaza. But offi- cials are concerned about the po- tential for a more embarrassing spectacle: prime-time disruptions inside the arena itself. \nAbortion rights groups have prevailed in all seven states where the question of how to regulate abortion has been put directly to voters in the two years since the demise of Roe, the 1973 decision that said the United States Consti- tution protected a right to abor- tion. \nAt the border, the detritus of a losing battle — and signs of sol- diers caught by surprise — were scattered about: bullet cartridges tinkled underfoot, discarded body armor lay on the asphalt. Taking the fight to Russian soil was a weighty moment for Ukraine in its war with Russia, coming two and a half years after Russia launched a full-scale inva- sion and 10 years after Russia in- tervened militarily to seize terri- tory and support separatist client states in eastern Ukraine. Within the first month of the war, Ukraine did strike back with a cross-border helicopter assault and has regularly bombarded \nUkrainian troops sliced easily through a thinly defended border, pushing tens of miles into Russia and shifting the narrative of the war after a glum year in which Ukraine had struggled, often in vain, to hold back Russian ad- vances across its eastern front. By Monday, Ukraine’s com- manding general had told Presi- dent Volodymyr Zelensky that his troops held 390 square miles of territory in Russia’s southeastern Kursk region. Two dozen settle- ments were overrun. \nKicking up dust, Ukrainian ar- mored vehicles rumbled past, un- impeded, as the flow of men and weaponry carried on in the big- gest foreign incursion into Russia since World War II, an offensive now nearing the end of its first week since the breach of the bor- der here in Sudzha and at several other sites. \nthe talks set to begin this week. Among other conditions, the latest document, presented to me- diators shortly before a summit in Rome on July 28, suggested that Israeli forces should remain in control of Gaza’s southern border, a detail that was not included in Is- rael’s proposal in May. It also showed less flexibility about al- lowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern  Continued on Page A9 \nThe run of abortion rights suc- cesses has put Republicans and anti-abortion groups on the defen- sive. They have mounted “decline to sign” campaigns, filed lawsuits trying to prevent signatures from being certified, and sponsored legislation trying to make it hard- er for ballot measures to pass. Be- fore the high court overturned Roe, almost every abortion-relat- ed ballot measure had been spon- sored by the anti-abortion side. Measures to establish or pro- tect abortion rights are already on the November ballot in six other states: Florida, South Dakota, Colorado, New York, Maryland and Nevada. But only Arizona and Nevada are seen as presidential battleground states, where Demo- crats are hoping that support for abortion rights will drive higher turnout in their favor. (South Da- kota and Missouri are the only two of those states with near-total  Continued on Page A15 \nAbout 30 uncommitted dele- gates representing the Democrat- ic primary voters who opposed President Biden — largely over what they see as his tilt toward Is- rael in the war launched after the Hamas attacks last October — will have unfettered access to make their voices heard. State party leaders, led by Lavora Barnes, the chairwoman of the Michigan Democratic Party, and Ken Mar- tin, the chairman of the Democrat- ic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minne- sota, have for months worked to defuse tensions and head off a high-profile clash. \nAt the crossing point, a Ukrain- ian soldier posted on the roadside waved at the forces passing by, days after Russia’s head of the general staff declared that the at- tack had been rebuffed. \ninto Russia, and it is better than  Continued on Page A8 \n# \nSusan Gibbs wants to rescue the storied S.S.

But as of now, the delegates are still planning to make their presence at the pro- Continued on Page A13 \nPHILADELPHIA  —  Susan Gibbs needs to find a new parking spot, fast. And not just any park- ing spot will do. \nIt’s for a ship bigger than the Ti- tanic, one that is nearly as long as the Chrysler Building is tall. A ship so luxurious that it was the first choice of presidents and roy- alty. A ship so trusted that it once carried the Mona Lisa. A vessel so fast that its mammoth propellers, churning the sea beneath its grand promenades and shipboard orchestras, were a Cold War state secret. \n# \nA ship named the United States that Ms. Gibbs has come to adore. In fact, she has dedicated her life to saving it. \n# \nMelted capsules. Cloudy insu- lin. Pills that may no longer work. Doctors and pharmacists say the scorching temperatures en- veloping the country could be en- dangering people’s health in an unexpected way: by overheating their medications. \nMail-order pharmacies say that their packaging is weather resist- ant and that they take special pre- cautions when medication “re- quires specific temperature con- trol.” But in a study published last year, independent pharmaceuti- cal researchers who embedded data-logging thermometers in- side simulated shipments found that the packages had spent more than two-thirds of their transit time outside the appropriate tem- perature range, “regardless of the shipping method, carrier, or sea- son.” \nMs.  Gibbs’s  grandfather William Francis Gibbs was a fa- mous ship designer, and the United States was his master- work. But remarkably, she knew almost nothing about that until she was well into adulthood. \nMillions of Americans now re- ceive their prescription medica- tions through mail-order ship- ments, either for convenience or because their health plans require it. But the temperatures inside the cargo areas of delivery trucks can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, according to drivers — far exceeding the range of 68 to 77 degrees recommended by the national organization that sets standards for drug handling. \n“This, I would not have pre- dicted,” she said recently about being responsible for a rusty steamship. \nAlong the way she shared her infectious appreciation for the his- toric vessel, telling stories from the glory days, back in the 1950s and ’60s. She spoke of the sweep- ing symbolism of such a luxuri- ous,  technologically  advanced ship carrying the nation’s name and laughed about how Salvador \nDalí would travel on the United States accompanied by his pet ocelot. \nA few days ago she drove from Washington  to  Philadelphia, where the United States is docked on the Delaware River. There, she would attend an important meet- ing of the small nonprofit group she heads, the S.S. United States Conservancy, which owns the ship. I joined her for the drive. \nMs. Gibbs, 62, works in Wash- ington at a private foundation where her primary focus is eradi- cating genital cutting of women. Between that and her advocacy for the ship, she noted, “People must be so confused by my social media presence.” \nYet a shadow hung over our drive. A ship-size shadow. The ship is being evicted from its pier in Philadelphia.
