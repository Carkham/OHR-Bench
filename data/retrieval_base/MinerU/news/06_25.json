More than 1,300 died making the Islamic pilgrimage this month. \n# \n# \nand deeply spiritual ritual that Muslims are encouraged to per- form once in their lifetimes if they are physically and financially able. \n# \n# \nCAIRO — More than 1,300 peo- ple died making the Islamic pil- grimage of hajj in Saudi Arabia this month, the vast majority of whom the Saudi government said did not have permits. Many walked for miles in scorching heat after paying thousands of dollars to illicit or fraudulent tour opera- tors. \n# \nWith nearly two million partici- pating each year, it is not unusual for pilgrims to die from heat stress, illness or chronic disease. It is unclear if the number of deaths this year was higher than usual, because Saudi Arabia does not regularly report those statis- tics. Last year, 774 pilgrims died from Indonesia alone, and in 1985, more than 1,700 people died around the holy sites, most of them from heat stress, a study at the time found. \nal-Jalajel, said in an interview on state television that 83 percent of the 1,301 reported deaths involved pilgrims who lacked permits. “The rise in temperatures dur- ing the hajj season represented a big challenge this year,” he said Sunday. “Unfortunately — and this is painful for all of us — those who didn’t have hajj permits walked long distances under the sun.” \n# \nLONDON — Will Lewis, now the publisher of The Washington Post, was in full crisis mode in 2011. Then an executive at a sub- sidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, he was an intermedi- ary to the police detectives inves- tigating a British phone-hacking scandal that had placed the com- pany’s journalists and top leaders in legal peril. \nWhile pilgrims with permits are transported around the holy city of Mecca in air-conditioned buses and rest in air-conditioned tents, unregistered ones are often ex- posed to the elements. In recent days, as temperatures surpassed 120 degrees, some pilgrims de- scribed watching people faint and passing bodies in the street. \nBut because so many of those who died had no permits, this year’s toll exposed an underbelly of tour operators and smugglers  \nMr. al-Jalajel’s remarks came after days of silence from the Saudi government over the fatali- ties during the hajj, an arduous \nFor years, reporters at News Corporation’s best-selling British tabloid had landed scoops by pay- ing public officials and illegally lis- tening to the voice mail messages of royals, politicians, celebrities and even a murdered girl. Mr. Lewis was supposed to cooperate with police, identify wrongdoing and help steer the company through the crisis. \n\nHis role, he would later say, was as a force for good. He was “drain- ing the swamp.” \nBut confidential documents ob- tained by The New York Times and interviews with people in- volved in the criminal investiga- tion show that, almost from the be- ginning, investigators with Lon- don’s Metropolitan Police were suspicious of News Corporation’s intentions, and came to view Mr. Lewis as an impediment. \nThe police suspected that News Corporation was trying to “steer the investigation into a very nar- row remit” by pointing the finger at a few journalists “while steer- ing the investigation away from other journalists and editors,” one of the lead detectives wrote in a previously undisclosed internal  \n# \n# \nComplications of Pregnancy and Fertility Sway Voters From Different Parties \n# \nIn the decades that Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, abortion rights groups tried to shore up support for it by declaring “Abor- tion Is Health Care.” \nAbortion opponents say that stories about women facing medi- cal complications are overblown and that women who truly need abortions for medical reasons have been able to get them under exceptions to the bans. \nconstitutional right to abortion, and just six months before the presidential election, has the slo- gan taken on the force of reality. The public conversation about abortion has grown into one about the complexities of pregnancy and reproduction, as the conse- quences of bans have played out in the news. The question is no longer just whether you can get an abortion, but also, Can you get one if pregnancy complications put you in septic shock? Can you find an obstetrician when so many are leaving states with bans? If you miscarry, will the hospital send you home to bleed? Can you and your partner do in vitro fertiliza- tion? \nStill, a poll in April found that 46 percent of registered voters had heard stories of women forced to cross state lines to get abortions they needed because of preg- nancy complications — up 11 points since September. In the lat- est abortion case before the Su- preme Court, justices from both ends of the ideological spectrum pressed lawyers for Idaho to ex- plain how the state could deny the procedure to a woman who was bleeding uncontrollably after her water had broken early. The Biden campaign has dis- patched six women to battle- ground states as it tries to mobi- lize voters around Monday’s two- \nThat shift helps explain why a record percentage of Americans are now declaring themselves sin- gle-issue voters on abortion rights — especially among Black voters, Democrats, women and those ages 18 to 29. Republican women are increasingly saying their par- ty’s opposition to abortion is too extreme, and Democrats are run- ning on the issue after years of running away from it. “When the Dobbs case came down, I told my friends — some- what but not entirely in jest — that America was about to be exposed to a lengthy seminar on obstet- rics,” said Elaine Kamarck, a fel- low at the Brookings Institution, referring to the Supreme Court \n\nProtesting a near-total abor- tion ban in Idaho this year. \n# \n# \nIn March, the first lady, Jill Bi- den, announced a new White House women’s health initiative that highlighted a seemingly ob- scure research question: What if you could delay menopause and all of the health risks associated with it? \nin humans that we just accept will fail one day,” said Renee Wegrzyn, the director of the Advanced Re- search  Projects  Agency  for Health, a government agency tasked with steering Dr. Biden’s mission. “It’s actually kind of wild that we all just accept that.” It is the ovaries’ truncated life span that also makes them such a promising  site  for  experi- mentation. Researchers think that prolonging their function, better aligning the length of their viabili- ty with that of other organs, could potentially alter the course of a woman’s health — and longevity research overall. \nThe question comes from a field of research that has started to draw attention over the last few years, as scientists who study lon- gevity and women’s health have come to realize that the female re- productive system is far more than just a baby-maker. The ova- ries, in particular, appear to be connected to virtually every as- pect of a woman’s health. \nDr. Wegrzyn said she hoped the White House initiative, in which researchers and startups are com- peting for a slice of the program’s \\$100 million budget, would high- light the connection between menopause and longevity, while also attracting more funding and talent to the field. “If you don’t think about ovari- \nThey also abruptly stop per- forming their primary role in midlife. Once that happens, a woman enters menopause, which accelerates her aging and the de- cline of other organ systems, like the heart and the brain.

They dismissed the struggle by women who challenged the law as a symptom of Western meddling. Now, as Iran holds a presiden- tial election this week, the issue of mandatory hijab, as the hair cov- \nering is known, has become a hot campaign topic.
