He would win. \nlics and Prime Minister Viktor Or- ban of Hungary, according to a re- view of dozens of speeches, inter- views and writings since Mr. Vance formally entered politics and interviews with people close to him. \nSHENZHEN, China — In the southern Chinese city of Shen- zhen, a mazelike market stretches for a half-mile, packed with stalls selling every type of electronic im- aginable. \nThrough  his  bumpy  early weeks as Mr. Trump’s junior part- ner, Mr. Vance has strained to combat a Democratic attack line that he is not just wrongheaded but “weird” and retrograde, prone to meditations on “childless socio- paths” and “cat ladies” and the ills of the sexual revolution. \nAnd when he did, Mr. Vance counseled, he needed the right people around him this time. “Fire every single midlevel bu- reaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative  state,  replace them with our people,” Mr. Vance said on a podcast. \nIt’s an open secret that vendors here are offering one of the world’s most sought-after tech- nologies: the microchips that cre- ate artificial intelligence, which the United States is battling to keep out of Chinese hands. \nOne vendor said he could order the chips for delivery in two weeks. Another said companies came to the market ordering 200 or 300 chips from him at a time. A third business owner said he re- cently shipped a big batch of serv- ers with more than 2,000 of the most advanced chips made by Nvidia, the U.S. tech company, from Hong Kong to mainland China. As evidence, he showed photos and a message with his supplier arranging the April deliv- ery for \\$103 million. \nOn a certain level, though, many of Mr. Vance’s intellectual allies agree with his opponents on a core premise: He has ascended while advancing some ideas that fall well outside the traditional po- litical mainstream, insisting that these zero-sum times require a zero-sum strategy. \n“Then when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did,” Mr. Vance said, citing a (possibly apocry- phal) quotation long attributed to America’s  seventh  president, “and say: ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him en- force it.’” \nHe has urged Republicans to “seize the endowments” of left- leaning universities, punishing nominal ideological foes through dramatic changes to the tax code, and  warmly  quotes  Richard Nixon’s observation about higher education: “The professors are the enemy.” \nIn his U-turning path from anti- Trump author to MAGA-approved Ohio senator and running mate, Mr. Vance has developed a reputa- tion for being ideologically pliable — open-minded, supporters say; core-less, critics counter. But he has been unswerving in recent years in his assessment of how Republicans should carry themselves when they win: Use every available lever of state, even if that means testing the bounds of the constitutional sys- tem. \nThe United States, with some success, has tried to control the export of these chips. Still, The New York Times has found an ac- tive trade in restricted A.I. tech- nology — part of a global effort to help China circumvent U.S. re- strictions amid the countries’ growing military rivalry. \nHe has suggested that parents should receive extra votes in elec- tions — one for each child in their care — to dilute the electoral power of the left.

He has drawn from influences as var- ied as a monarchist blogger, “postliberal” conservative Catho- \njust trying to make a few bucks and survive.

No, they regret nothing. \n# \n# \n# \nFirst came the death of its top leader abroad, Ismail Haniyeh, by a bomb planted in Tehran. Then came Israel’s announcement that, only weeks earlier, it had killed Hamas’s most elusive and revered military leader. All of this as Israel continues to wage the deadliest war Palestinians in the Hamas- ruled Gaza Strip have ever faced. At first tally, the latest score in the 30-year struggle between Is- rael and Hamas looks like a devas- tating one for the Islamist move- ment, one that throws its future into question. Yet the history of Hamas, the evolution of Palestin- ian militant groups over the dec- ades and the logic of insurgencies more broadly suggest that not only will Hamas survive, it may even emerge politically stronger. Analysts and regional observ- ers in contact with Hamas leaders see the latest blows it has suffered — including Mr. Haniyeh’s assas- sination, widely believed to be at Israel’s hand — as offering Israeli forces a short-term victory at the cost of long-term strategic suc- cess. \nDHAKA, Bangladesh — At least 70 people were killed in clashes between security forces and protesters on Sunday in Bangladesh, as the country’s lead- ers imposed a new curfew and in- ternet restrictions to try to quell a growing antigovernment move- ment. \nThe revival of student protests after a deadly government crack- down late last month, as well as a call by the governing party for its own supporters to take to the streets, has plunged the country of over 170 million into a particu- larly dangerous phase. \nThe exact number of deaths in the violence on Sunday was un- clear, but it appeared to be the deadliest day since the protests began in July. A diplomatic official in Dhaka, the capital, said the toll across Bangladesh was at least 72, while tallies by local news media and the protest coordinators put the count at between 70 and 93. At least 13 of the dead were police of- ficers, the country’s Police Head- quarters said in a statement. \n# \ntacled 17-year-old table tennis player from Montpellier.
