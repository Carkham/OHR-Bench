It was a blow to the conservative faction in Iran’s ruling establishment and a major victory for the relatively moderate reformist camp, which had been sidelined from politics for the past few years. \nCaspar  Grosse,  a  German medic in that unit, said he saw the soldier plead for medical attention in a mix of broken English and Russian. It was dusk. A team member looked for bandages. \nAfter polls closed at midnight, turnout stood at roughly 50 per- cent, about 10 percentage points higher than in the first round, with \nPresident Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris celebrated the Fourth of July at the White House with their families on Thursday. \nabout 30.5 million ballots cast, ac- cording to the interior ministry. The first round had a record-low turnout as many Iranians boy- cotted. But the prospect of a hard- line administration that would double down on strict social rules, including enforcing mandatory hi- jabs for women, and remain defi- ant in negotiations to lift interna- tional economic sanctions, appar- ently spurred Iranians to turn out. \n# \nGrosse recalled in an interview. Mr. Grosse said he was so upset by the episode that he confronted his commander. He said he spoke to The New York Times after what he regarded as unwarranted killings continued. It is highly un- usual for a soldier to speak pub- licly about battlefield conduct, particularly involving men whom he still considers friends. But he said he was too troubled to keep silent. \n# \n# \nSELMA, Ala. — By early this year, around the time a prosecutor called President Biden a “well- meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Vice President Kamala Harris already knew something had to change. \nthan 60 trips this year alone. She tossed talking points to speak out more forcefully on abortion rights, the war in Gaza and race. She in- voked her personal story more of- ten, from her mother’s influence on her life to her inspiration for be- coming a prosecutor. \nTrump. He does not believe much of his own party wants him to step aside. \nAll sounds fine in President Biden’s world. That devastating debate? Just a bad night. Those dismal poll numbers? Simply inaccurate. The gloomy election predictions? The NEWS same old doomsay- \n“The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, compassion and trust,” Mr. Pezeshkian wrote on social media after his win. In an- other post, he thanked the young people “who came to work lov- ingly and sincerely for Iran” and “shined a ray of hope and confi- dence in the future.” \nHis prime-time interview that aired on ABC News on Friday night was an exercise not just in damage control but in reality control. For much of his long and storied political career, Mr. Biden has succeeded through sheer force of will, defying the doubters and the skeptics and the scorn- ers to prove that he could do what no one expected. Yet now, in what may be the most threat- ened moment of his presidency, that self-confidence leaves him increasingly isolated in his own party. \nThe shooting of the unarmed, wounded Russian soldier is one of several killings that have unset- tled the Chosen Company, one of the best-known units of interna- tional troops fighting on behalf of Ukraine. \nIt was up to her, she had told al- lies, to finally distinguish herself in her job — something she had been struggling to do for more than two years — and reassure American voters that the Biden- Harris ticket was still a safe bet. She had been feeling sidelined in the early stages of the campaign, one adviser said, and she wanted a bigger role. \nHer allies emphasize that she has been taking on a bigger role for some time, notably after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and during high-profile foreign assignments. But even before the questions about Mr. Biden’s age and acuity burst into the open, people close to her say, she was looking for more powerful ways to support the ticket. \nFor Mr. Biden, the crisis seen by so many Democrats who are not on his payroll — and by some who are — is nothing more than another bump in the road, an- other obstacle to overcome as he always has. He does not agree that he is slipping as he ages. He does not accept that he is losing to former President Donald J. \nMr. Pezeshkian said during the campaign that he recognized fix- ing the economy was inextricably linked to foreign policy — namely the standoff with the West over the nuclear program — and would negotiate to lift sanctions. He has said he opposes the mandatory hijab law. But when it  Continued on Page 7 \nMr. Grosse’s witness recollec- tion is the only available evidence of the trench killing.

She found The Ripped Bodice — a bookstore in Culver City that was doing so well, it was expanding to a second location in Brooklyn. “That was intimidating,” she said. \nIf their success was daunting, it also suggested that there might be room for another romance store. So this February, she opened Smitten on a busy strip of Main Street, about 60 miles from her competitor. \nOver the last two years, the U.S. went from having two dedicated romance bookstores to a network of more than 20. \nhas become a vibrant hub for ro- mance readers, with author sign- ings, tarot readings, book clubs and trivia and craft nights. Customers  sometimes  ap- proach her with highly specific re- quests. “Someone came in and was like, ‘I like fantasy, I want it to be queer, I want it to have repre- sentation from a different culture and I want it to be as smutty as possible,’” Tingstrom said. And they come in often. “I have regulars who come a couple of times a week,” Tingstrom said. \n“I’m like, didn’t you just buy two books the other day?” Once a niche that independent booksellers largely ignored, ro- mance is now the hottest thing in the book world. It is, by far, the top-selling fiction genre, and its success is reshaping not only the publishing industry, but the retail landscape as well.
