Epstein , Katie Rogers ,  Erica L. Green  and Shane Goldmacher . \nIn 2000, a ruling in a U.S. an- titrust case against Microsoft helped set the rules of competi- tion for the digital giant of its day. \nWASHINGTON — Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris, the Demo- cratic nominee for president, chose Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate on Tuesday, elevating a former football coach whose rural roots, liberal policies and buzzy takedowns of former President Donald J. Trump have recently put him on the map. \nAt the time, a federal judge said Microsoft had abused the monopoly power of its Windows operating system and ordered that the company be split up. A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were up- held. And Microsoft was prohibit- ed from forcing restrictive con- tracts on its industry partners and ordered to open some of its technology to outsiders — pre- venting the company from sin- gle-handedly controlling the internet. \nWith his straight-talking style, Mr. Walz was thought to be some- one who could match up well in a debate against Senator JD Vance of Ohio, whom Mr. Trump chose last month as his running mate. And after two weeks of vetting and deliberations, Ms. Harris con- nected best with Mr. Walz in com- parison with the other choices. Over and over in the selection process, loyalty had been empha- sized as one of the most important criteria for Harris. This suggests that Mr. Walz convinced her he would support her not only in win- ning but also in helping her gov- ern. \nMr. Walz, 60, emerged from a field of candidates who had better name recognition and more politi- cally advantageous home states. Minnesota is not a top-tier presi- dential battleground and is un- likely to prove critical to a Harris- Walz victory. \nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case similarly promises to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Amit P . Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search \nBut he jumped to the top of Ms. Harris’s list in a matter of days, helped by cable news appear- ances in which he declared that Republicans were “weird.” The new, clear articulation of why vot- ers should reject Mr. Trump caught on fast and turned the spotlight on the plain-spoken Mid- westerner behind it. \nIn her social media post, Ms. Harris highlighted Mr. Walz’s bi- ography as a National Guards- man and his time as a high school teacher, football coach and advis- er of the Gay-Straight Alliance. She also pointed to his efforts as governor to work with Republi- cans on bipartisan measures while pushing progressive priori- ties. \nGoogle’s loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own prod- ucts on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Judge Mehta, are likely to weigh heav- ily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next \n“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convic- tions on fighting for middle class families run deep,” Ms. Harris said in a social media post con- firming his selection. “It’s person- al.” \nMr. Walz is in his second term as governor and spent 12 years in Congress, where he was the rare Midwestern Democrat represent- Continued on Page A14 \nMr. Walz (pronounced Walls) appeared with Ms. Harris at a rally on Tuesday evening in Phila- delphia, their first appearance as the Democratic ticket. In his own post on social media, Mr. Walz said it was the “honor of a life- time” to be chosen as her running mate. \nVice President Kamala Harris with Gov.

PAGE A16 \n# \nOctober, Hezbollah has been fighting a second, smaller battle along the Lebanon-Israel border to bog down Israeli forces and help Hamas, its ally in Gaza. The violence there has killed hun- dreds of people and displaced more than 150,000 in both coun- tries, leaving the border zone dotted with rubble-strewed ghost towns. \n# \n# \n# \n# \nBINT JBEIL, Lebanon — The town in south Lebanon appeared deserted, its roads empty and its market shuttered, after months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel across the nearby border made many residents \nRolling sod on the Robinsons’ farm in Lino Lakes, Minn. \nto pay their respects. Watching the procession, Asmaa Alawiyeh, an accountant, said life was hard after months of clashes. Her two children were out of school. Her husband, a plumber, could not find work. And no one knew when life would return to normal. “There is no plan,” said Ms. Alawiyeh, 32. “We have no idea what to prepare for because we have no idea what’s coming.” Since the Gaza war began in \n# \nLINO LAKES, Minn. — Butch Robinson is done. After dedicating most of his 77 years to growing sod, he just wants to sell his sprawl of green and ease his aching back into the lounge chair of a hard-earned retirement. That is why Mr. Robinson and the two sons who run the family farm with him, both with nagging backs, were delighted when a de- veloper put down a nonrefundable retainer for 156 of their acres on the fast-growing fringe of the Twin Cities exurb of Lino Lakes, Minn. The builder’s ambitious plan called for a housing development for 434 homes. It would include shops, restaurants, tennis courts, soccer fields, a park with a pavil- ion — and a 40,000-square-foot mosque. \nNow, fear has spread that a broader war could erupt, after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah official in response to an attack from Lebanon that killed 12 children and teenagers in an Israeli-controlled town in which the group denied its involvement. Hours after the killing, a Hamas leader was assassinated in Iran;  Continued on Page A7 \n# \nBut in a central square this summer, Hezbollah had erected huge banners for the triple fu- neral of a man the militant group claimed as its own and his two sisters, all killed when Israel bombed their home in this south- ern town of Bint Jbeil. As the coffins arrived, martial music blared and a few hundred of the remaining residents came \nPARIS — As Tang Zhongqiu knows, there often comes a time in an Asian person’s trip to France when one grows weary of the end- less parade of bread and seeks respite in a simple bowl of rice. \nSo while Tang assumed there would be an uptick in customers at his Chinese restaurant in the 15th arrondissement of Paris after a nearby convention hall was con- verted into the table tennis arena for the Summer Olympics, he had no idea it would be like this. \nIn Bint Jbeil, Lebanon, in July, mourning the deaths of a Hezbollah member and his two sisters. \nthem. Scowling like a principal an- ticipating school-assembly misbe- havior, the mayor expressed hope for a “good positive session.” Then everyone stood to pledge allegiance to one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. \nFor the past two weeks, his nar- row restaurant, Yang Xiao Chu, has been transformed into a bustling, unofficial clubhouse for table tennis, a sport followed most fervently and practiced most suc- cessfully in China. His store — one of the closest Chinese restaurants to the arena, but far enough that you would need to have sought it out — has been practically burst- ing at the seams with current Olympians, former gold med- alists, team staff members, jour- nalists and countless hungry fans. “I didn’t expect we would get this busy during the Olympics,” Tang said one recent morning, be- fore the lunch rush. “I just look af- ter them as if they were my family members.” \nSo began a conflagration over a small emerald swath of the Ameri- can dream, fueled by colliding hopes and mutual distrust. At the dispute’s core: clashing interpre- tations of what inclusion looks like. \nHarold Robinson isn’t sure how he became “Butch,” but the nick- name has stuck for decades, just as he’s been stuck in pretty much the only place he’s ever known. His father and an uncle bought the land in the 1940s and turned the wiregrass fields into a farm for vegetables and, eventually, sod. For many years, Butch Robinson lived here with his parents and three siblings in a small home with an outhouse and an un- obstructed view. “No neighbors at all,” he said. \nIt culminated last month with a packed City Council hearing on a proposal to pause development in the precise corner of Lino Lakes that features the Robinson sod farm.  Butch  Robinson  was present, his white hair tucked un- der a U.S.A. baseball cap. So was the developer. So was the resident leading the opposition. \nHe helped out with the crop, lost part of a thumb in the process,  Continued on Page A12 \nTang, much to his disbelief, has  Continued on Page A6 \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nNever a Gold, Silver or Bronze For 66 countries and territories, the wait for an Olympic medal goes on, and on, and on.
