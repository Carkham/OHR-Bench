The incursion did not appear to be the long-anticipated full-scale invasion of Rafah, a city crowded with about a million Palestinians, which Israel’s allies have been working to avert by pushing for a cease-fire deal. \nWhen Donald J. Trump met Stormy Daniels, their flirtation seemed fleeting: He was a 60- year-old married mogul at the peak of reality television fame, and she was 27, not half his age, a Louisiana native raised in poverty and headed to pornographic star- dom. \nBut that chance encounter in Lake Tahoe, Nev., some two dec- ades ago set off a chain of events that has brought the nation the first criminal trial of an American president. \nAnd on Tuesday, Ms. Daniels took the stand at that trial, bring- ing the former president face to face with the porn star at the case’s center. \nInternational humanitarian of- ficials said the military operation had halted the flow of aid from Egypt into Gaza, exacerbating ex- treme hunger and privation in the besieged territory. \n# \nThe charges stem from her story of sex with Mr. Trump dur- ing that 2006 celebrity golf tour- nament in Lake Tahoe, a story she was shopping a decade later, in the closing days of the 2016 presiden- tial campaign. Mr. Trump’s long- time lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid her \\$130,000 in hush money before Election Day, and the former president is accused of falsifying business records to cover up reimbursements for Mr. Cohen. \n“The situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word,” said Dr. Suhaib Hems, the head of Kuwait Hospital in Rafah, adding that 27 bodies and 150 wounded people had been brought to the hospital since Israeli tanks entered the city. \nmonths later, and people are al- ready forgetting,” Mr. Biden said. “They are already forgetting.

It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. “I have not forgotten, nor have you,” he told the crowd of more than 100, including Holocaust sur- vivors. “And we will not forget.” Since the outset of the war, Mr. Biden has faced criticism from Arab Americans and Palestinians  Continued on Page A15 \nHolocaust, either.” For Mr. Biden, a self-described Zionist, the speech was a clear as- sertion of his support for Jewish Americans as he struggles to bal- ance his support for Israel with in- creasingly forceful calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza. Mr. Biden’s address also comes as protests against Israel’s war in Gaza roil college campuses, with students demanding that the Bi- den administration stop sending weapons to Israel. In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and har- assment targeting Jewish stu- dents. \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden on Tuesday condemned a “ferocious surge of antisemitism” in the United States following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack against Israel and said people were already for- getting the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. \nThe Israeli military said it had killed about 20 people in Rafah, describing the dead as Hamas militants. \ndent said. But, he added, “there is no place on any campus in Amer- ica, any place in America, for anti- semitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.” Mr. Biden also denounced at- tempts to minimize the Hamas at- tacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed an estimated 34,000 people in Gaza. \nHamas said it had fired on Is- raeli soldiers on Tuesday at an- other vital aid crossing, near Kerem Shalom, along Gaza’s southern border with Israel. The Israeli military said that four mor- tar shells and two rockets had been launched toward Kerem Shalom from Rafah but that no in- \nMs. Daniels’s fast-paced testi- mony lasted nearly five hours, during which she described an en- counter with Mr. Trump, now 77, that he has long denied. Tension gripped the courtroom, her garru- lous testimony filling a heavy si- lence. She made jokes; they did not land. \nSpeaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Days of Re- membrance, Mr. Biden tied the anti-Jewish sentiment that led to the Nazi effort to exterminate Jews directly to Oct. 7. \nSPLIT SCREEN  Two presidents and two wildly disparate events.

He answered the door wearing silk pajamas. When he was rude, she playfully spanked him with a rolled-up magazine. And when she asked about his wife, he told her not to worry, that they didn’t even sleep in the same room — prompting Mr. Trump to shake his head in disgust and mut- ter “bullshit” to his lawyers. \n# \n# \nRIO DE JANEIRO — Just a few months ago, the political movement behind Brazil’s far- right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, was sputtering. Mr. Bolsonaro had been \nBERKELEY, Calif. — The con- troversy began with a walkout. On Oct. 18, hundreds of Berke- ley High School students, with the blessing of some of their teachers, left their classrooms in the middle of the day and gathered at a nearby park. \nMs. Daniels then recounted the sex itself in graphic detail. It hap- pened, she said, after she re- turned from the bathroom and found Mr. Trump in his boxer shorts and T-shirt. She tried to leave and he blocked her path, though not, she said, in a threat- ening manner. The sex was brief, she said, and although she never  Continued on Page A18 \nNEWS voted out of office, ANALYSIS ruled ineligible to run in the next \n“Free Palestine!” they chanted. “Stop bombing Gaza!” \nelection and was in the cross hairs of deepening criminal investigations. \n“From the river to the sea!” One of their teachers, Becky Villagran, thanked the crowd of roughly 150, telling them not to forget that the toll of the victims of the war in Gaza was more than a number. \nBut now Mr. Bolsonaro and his followers have had a sudden surge of energy and momentum — with the help of Elon Musk and the Republican Party. \nOver the past month, Mr. Musk and House Republicans have harshly criticized Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is leading investigations into Mr. Bol- sonaro, over the judge’s moves to block more than 100 social media accounts in Brazil. Many of them belong to prominent right-wing pundits, podcasters and federal lawmakers who, in some cases, have questioned Mr. Bolsonaro’s election loss. \nJust as on the nearby campus of the University of California — famed since the 1960s for its marches, sit-ins and progressive ideals — students at Berkeley High have a long history of hitting the streets in dissent. In the 1960s, they walked out to oppose the Vietnam War. In the 1990s, they pushed to create ethnic studies courses. More recently, they have shown up in droves to advocate for Black Lives Matter, immigra- tion reform, reproductive rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. \nDELAY  The judge in the records case tossed a May 20 start date, failing to set a new one.
