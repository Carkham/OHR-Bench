Trump before being spirited away by the Secret Service on Saturday in Butler, Pa. \n# \nThis article is by  Michael Gold ,  Si- mon J. Levien  and  Julian E. Barnes . BUTLER, Pa. — Former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump was injured in a shooting just minutes into his rally on Saturday in Butler, Pa., in what officials said they were in- vestigating as an assassination at- tempt. \nit would pause “all outbound com- munications” and was working to “pull down our television ads as quickly as possible.” The move re- flects a desire to put politics aside while the crisis of a likely assassi- nation attempt on a presidential candidate plays out. \nMr. Trump had been showing supporters a chart of numbers about border crossings, which his audiovisual  staff  placed  on screens above the stage, when the shots rang out. \nA rallygoer was killed in the shooting and the suspected gun- man was killed by the Secret Serv- ice, according to a federal official and two people also briefed on the matter. \nThe former president ducked quickly, with the sound coming from the bleachers to the left of where he was standing at a lectern. The noises came in two groups, and smoke rose from that section of the bleachers. \nMr. Trump was “fine” and being treated at a hospital, according to a spokesman for his campaign. He was escorted off the stage by Se- cret Service agents, with his face and ear bloodied. As he was taken to his motorcade, he pumped his fist in a defiant gesture to the crowd. \nAs members of the crowd began screaming, Mr. Trump was tack- led by Secret Service agents. Offi- cials shouted for the crowd to duck and cover, whisking mem- bers of the news media off the press riser where they had been watching Mr. Trump’s speech. Theresa Koshut, a teacher from Pittsburgh who was in the fifth row, said she immediately ducked when she heard the shots. Ms. Koshut was all too familiar with active-shooting drills from school. “I dropped and rolled under the bleachers,” she said. “I didn’t even think.” \nIn a statement, a spokesman for the Secret Service said that in ad- dition to the rallygoer who was killed, two others were critically injured. The suspected gunman “fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside the rally venue,” the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said. \nIn a post on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr. Trump re- counted the shooting. “I knew im- mediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.” \n# \nAfter a brief pause, Mr. Trump rose, surrounded by a group of uniformed Secret Service mem- bers. He pumped his fist to the crowd and then was rushed off the stage and ushered into his motor- cade, which quickly left the venue, the Butler Farm Show, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. After he departed, police offi- cials began cordoning off the area with crime-scene tape as attend- ees began clearing out. Blood was visible on the bleachers. Those who attend Mr. Trump’s  \ndictating how results are officially certified in the weeks before the transfer of power. \nprovised challenge four years ago, the new drive includes a system- atic search for any vulnerability in the nation’s patchwork election system. \n# \n# \nAt the heart of the strategy is a drive to convince voters that the election is about to be stolen, even without evidence. Democrats use mail voting, drop boxes and voter registration drives to swing elec- tions, they have argued. And Mr. Trump’s indictments and criminal conviction are a Biden adminis- tration tactic to interfere with the election, they claim. \nThe Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system. Their wide-ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest an election that they argue, falsely, is already being rigged against former Pres- ident Donald J. Trump. The campaign involves a pow- erful network of Republican law- \n# \nMr. Trump’s allies have fol- lowed a two-pronged approach: restricting voting for partisan ad- vantage ahead of Election Day and short-circuiting the process of ratifying the winner afterward, if Mr. Trump loses.

They emerge from hiding in plain clothes, sometimes wearing sandals or tracksuits, before firing on Israeli troops, attaching mines to their vehicles or firing rockets from launchers in civilian areas. They rig abandoned homes with explosives and tripwires, sometimes luring Israeli soldiers to enter the booby-trapped build- ings by scattering signs of a Ha- mas presence. Through eight months of fight- ing in Gaza, Hamas’s military wing — the Qassam Brigades — has fought as a decentralized and largely hidden force, in contrast to its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which began with a coordinated large- scale maneuver in which thou- sands of uniformed commandos surged through border towns and killed roughly 1,200 people. Instead of confronting the Is- raeli invasion that followed in frontal battles, most Hamas fight- ers have retreated from their bases and outposts, seeking to blunt Israel’s technological and numerical advantage by launch- ing surprise attacks on small  Continued on Page 6 \nDr. Ruth in 2000.
