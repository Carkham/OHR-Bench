Remote-control trains have killed three rail inspectors since 2015. \nGlobal Anger at Strike That Burned Camp \nTARIFFS ON CHEAP E.V.S \nWeighing Labor Support and Climate Fears in an Election Year \n# \nJERUSALEM — With interna- tional condemnation mounting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- yahu of Israel said on Monday that the killing of dozens of people a day earlier at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was “a tragic accident,” but gave no sign of curbing the Israeli offensive in the southern Gaza city. \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden wants more of America’s cars and trucks to run on electrici- ty, not gas. His administration has pushed that goal on multiple fronts, including strict new regu- lations of auto emissions and lav- ish new subsidies to help Ameri- can consumers take as much as \\$7,500 off the cost of a new electric vehicle. \nThe deadly fire that tore through the encampment on Sun- day after an airstrike came at a particularly delicate time for Is- rael, just days after the Interna- tional Court of Justice appeared to order the country’s military to halt its offensive in Rafah and as diplo- mats were aiming to restart nego- tiations for a cease-fire deal be- tween Israel and Hamas. \nMr. Biden’s aides agree that electric vehicles — which retail for more than \\$53,000 on average in the United States — would sell even faster here if they were less expensive. As it happens, there is a wave of new electric vehicles significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Eu- rope. \nSunday was a Hamas compound, and that “precise munitions” had been used to target a commander and another senior militant offi- cial there. \nBut at least 45 people, including children, were killed by the blast and by the fires it set off, accord- ing to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry said that 249 people were wounded. \n# \n# \nBut the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars, which retail elsewhere for as little as \\$10,000, because they are made in China. That’s true even though a surge of low-cost imported electric vehi- cles might help drive down car prices overall, potentially helping Mr. Biden in his re-election cam- paign at a time when inflation re- mains voters’ top economic con- cern. \nions have also lodged demands to step up safety measures as the trains increasingly operate on open tracks outside the confines of a rail yard. \n# \nThis article is by  Frances Robles , Sergio Olmos ,  Mark Walker  and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs . \nIn a speech to the Israeli Parlia- ment on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said the military had sought to protect noncombatants, by issu- ing evacuation orders, adding that about a million civilians had left Rafah ahead of, or during, the of- fensive. “Despite our supreme ef- fort not to harm uninvolved civil- ians,” he said,   $\\mathrm{{}^{u}a}$   tragic accident occurred to our regret last night.” \n# \nOne evening last June, as Es- ther Iradukunda set the table for dinner at her home in Buffalo, she heard a high-pitched cry through the kitchen window. She rushed outside and followed the screams to the train tracks that ran about 100 feet away from her house. \nOnly a few months after Aron was hit, the body of a woman who lived nearby was found in pieces along the same tracks, in a re- markably similar accident. \n# \nWASHINGTON  —  Richard Grenell’s quest to be secretary of state in a second Trump adminis- tration began late on Election Day in 2020, when the defeated presi- dent dispatched loyalists to run shambolic “stop the steal” opera- tions in battleground states. \nNo one from the railroad had heard the boy’s screams or no- ticed him trapped on the tracks. The train had no conductor or en- gineer onboard; instead, its move- ment was being controlled by a re- mote operator who was not aboard the train and, under rail- road protocols, could have been more than a half-mile away. While  trains  have  long presented a deadly risk to pedes- trians, a recent rash of accidents involving remote-control locomo- tives like the one in Buffalo has prompted a new federal review of the technology long billed by the railroad industry as safer than conventional trains. Railroad un- \nA railroad inspector in Ohio was killed in September when he stepped into the path of a remote- controlled locomotive. He was the third rail inspector since 2015 to die after being struck by a remote locomotive. \nInstead, the president is taking steps to make Chinese electric ve- hicles prohibitively expensive, in large part to protect American au- tomakers. Mr. Biden signed an ex- ecutive action this month that quadruples tariffs on those cars to 100 percent. \nShe found her young brother Aron lying on the tracks, run over when he chased a ball between the cars of a train that had suddenly begun to move. Now it was stopped again, but one of the boy’s legs was lodged underneath, the bone jutting through the skin, and he had grave wounds to his abdo- men. \nPresident Donald J. Trump tapped Mr. Grenell — his combat- ive former ambassador to Ger- many, acting national intelligence chief and special envoy to the Balkans — to fly by private plane to Nevada, where Mr. Grenell en- sconced himself, his dog Lola, law- yers and a crew of activists in a suite at the Venetian Resort, which served as the group’s war room in Las Vegas. In a dayslong spectacle, the Trump team filed a lawsuit and aired false accusa- tions of fraud, including one wrongly implicating hundreds of members of the military. \nIn Houston last year, an intoxi- cated man was found dead, with his leg severed, in an area where remote locomotives were in use. Two years earlier, a woman in the same part of Houston lost both her legs after trying to cross between cars of a remote train that began moving. \ntragedy. For Hamas, it’s a strat- egy. That’s the whole difference.” As images of the dead and maimed reached screens around the world, the condemnation was instant. The latest opprobrium ap- peared likely to make it still hard- er for Israel to continue its cam- paign against Hamas in Rafah, the southern city to which about a mil- Continued on Page A10 \nThose tariffs will put many po- tential Chinese imports at a signif- icant cost disadvantage to electric vehicles made in America. But some models, like the discount BYD Seagull, could still cost less than some American rivals even after tariffs, which is one reason Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and some other Democrats have called on Mr. Biden to ban Chinese E.V. imports entirely. \nMs. Iradukunda desperately pulled her brother clear just as the train began moving again, rolling slowly toward the CSX train yards about a quarter-mile away.

Videos of the performance have drawn mil- lions of views online. \n# \nThe smash hit isn’t a popular Broadway musical or a series of concerts by a pop star — it’s a play based on a classic 19th-century Ukrainian novel, “The Witch of Konotop,” and the mood is any- thing but upbeat. Consider the opening line: “It is sad and gloomy.” \n# \n\nBy RICHARD SANDOMIR Bill Walton, a center whose ex- traordinary passing and rebound- ing skills helped him win two na- tional college championships with U.C.L.A. and one each with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Boston Celtics of the N.B.A., and who overcame a stutter to become a loquacious commentator, died on Monday at his home in San Diego.

The ac- tion takes place against the back- drop of a military threat from czarist Russia — something that has resonated with Ukrainians to- day as they absorb daily, and often discouraging, news about the bat- tlefield and brace for missile strikes from modern Russia on their cities at night. \nBill Walton won two titles in the N.B.A. and two in college. \nA redheaded hippie and de- voted Grateful Dead fan, Walton was an acolyte of U.C.L.A. Coach John Wooden and the hub of the Bruins team that won N.C.A.A. championships in 1972 and 1973 and extended an 88-game win- ning streak that had begun in 1971. He was named the national player of the year three times. Walton’s greatest game was the \nthe full-scale invasion of the coun- try by Russia in February 2022 that has manifested itself in the- ater, literature and art. This in- cludes the culture of the Cossacks, the seminomadic people who pop- ulated the steppes of Ukraine and southern Russia. \n“It is very hard to overplay the harsh reality Ukrainians are liv- ing in now, but theater should feel the mood of the time and the peo- ple,” said Mr. Uryvsky. “When it manages to do that, then the play will touch people’s hearts.” The play’s success also under- lines  a  renewed  interest  in Ukraine’s cultural heritage since \naudiences were particularly capti- vated by the sense of impending tragedy in the play, which is per- formed at the Ivan Franko theater in Kyiv. \n1973  national  championship against Memphis State, played in St. Louis.
