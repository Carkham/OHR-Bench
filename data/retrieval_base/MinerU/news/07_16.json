Vance of Ohio to be his running mate, wagering that the young senator will bring fresh energy to the Republican ticket and ensure that the movement Mr. Trump began nearly a decade ago can live on after him. \n# \nThe federal judge overseeing former  President  Donald  J. Trump’s  classified  documents case threw out all of the charges against him on Monday, ruling that Jack Smith, the special coun- sel who filed the indictment, had been given his job in violation of the Constitution. \nspecial counsel,” said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special coun- sel. “The Justice Department has authorized the special counsel to appeal the court’s order.” \nMr. Vance, 39, is a political new- comer who entered the Senate only last year, but he has spent that time methodically ascending the conservative firmament. \nthe case still might never go in front of a jury. \nOnce an acerbic Trump critic — attacking Mr. Trump as “repre- hensible” and calling him “cultur- al heroin” — he won Mr. Trump’s backing in his 2022 Senate race by wholly embracing his politics and his lies about a stolen election. The endorsement lifted him above a crowded field, and ultimately to the Senate. \nIt has long been clear that the documents case would not go to trial before the election in Novem- ber, largely because of the glacial pace with which Judge Cannon has handled it. Should Mr. Trump be elected president again, he could simply have his Justice De- partment dismiss the case if it is reinstated on appeal — and even if he does not, longstanding Justice Department policy forbids pros- ecuting a sitting president. But Judge Cannon’s decision to \nIn a stunning decision delivered on the first day of the Republican National Convention, the judge, Aileen M. Cannon, found that Mr. Smith’s appointment as special counsel was improper because it was not based on a specific federal statute and because he had not been named to the post by the president or confirmed by the Senate. \nMr. Vance, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who became best known for writing the memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” did not forget it. He quickly emerged as a top de- fender of the former president in the halls of Congress and on tele- vision, taking his cues from Mr. Trump while frequently bucking the priorities of Senator Mitch McConnell, the chamber’s long- time Republican leader. \nShe also found that Mr. Smith had been improperly funded by the Treasury Department. \nBoxes of documents stored in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago. \nThe ruling by Judge Cannon, who was put on the bench by Mr. Trump in his final year in office, flew in the face of previous court decisions reaching back to the Watergate era that upheld the le- gality of the ways in which inde- pendent prosecutors have been put into their posts. \nMr.  Trump  announced  his choice in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, on Mon- day as the Republican National Convention was getting under- way in Milwaukee. He said that Mr. Vance was “the person best suited” to be his potential vice president. He highlighted Mr. Vance’s time in the Marine Corps and his memoir, saying he be- lieved Mr. Vance was a champion for hardworking people, particu- larly the workers and farmers in a number of key swing states. \nIt handed Mr. Trump a major le- gal victory two days after he was wounded in a shooting at a cam- paign rally and at the very onset of the political pageant where he is set to formally become his party’s presidential nominee. \nThe classified documents case, which was being heard in Federal District Court in Fort Pierce, Fla., once appeared to be the most straightforward of the four crimi- nal prosecutions that Mr. Trump has faced. He was charged last year with illegally holding on to classified national security ma- terials after leaving office and then obstructing government ef- forts to retrieve them along with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos DeOliveira. The charges against Mr. Nauta and Mr. DeOliveira were also \ndismiss the indictment in its en- tirety at such a consequential mo- ment in Mr. Trump’s campaign was a remarkable development for the former president’s legal and political future, giving him more ammunition to portray the prosecution as an effort by Presi- dent Biden and his allies to under- cut him in the election. \nsylvania, an episode that under- lined the significance of his choos- ing a running mate who might be in line as Mr. Trump’s successor. Mr. Vance, an ardent and vocal defender of Mr. Trump, went fur- ther than many of his allies, di- rectly attributing the shooting to the rhetoric of President Biden and his campaign, even as Mr. Trump and his campaign called for unity. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that Presi- dent Donald Trump is an authori- tarian  fascist  who  must  be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted  assassination,”  Mr. \nJ.D.

Instead, local law en- forcement officials in Butler, Pa., were given responsibility for the building, and no police officers were stationed on the roof itself. The building, used as a ware- house by equipment manufactur- er AGR International, has become a focal point of investigations into the shooting that nearly felled a former American president, one that Homeland Security Secre- tary Alejandro N. Mayorkas on Monday called a security failure. The first question is why the building, about 450 feet from the stage, was left out of the pe- rimeter.
