KELLER and  JENNIFER VALENTINO-DeVRIES \nWhen  a  children’s  jewelry maker began advertising on In- stagram, she promoted photos of a 5-year-old girl wearing a sparkly charm to users interested in par- enting, children, ballet and other topics identified by Meta as ap- pealing mostly to women. \nThis article is by  Ben Protess ,  Jo- nah E. Bromwich  and  Maggie Ha- berman . \nMichael D. Cohen, the do- anything fixer who once boasted of burying Donald J. Trump’s se- crets and spreading his lies, took the stand at the former presi- dent’s criminal trial in Manhattan on Monday and exposed those machinations to the jury and the world. \npaign from Instagram, the oppo- site had happened: The ads had gone almost entirely to adult men. Perplexed and concerned, the merchant contacted The New York Times, which in recent years has published multiple articles about the abuse of children on so- cial media platforms. In February, The Times investigated Insta- gram accounts run by parents for their young daughters, and the dark underworld of men who have sexualized interactions with those accounts. \nNarrating  the  prosecution’s case in tell-all detail, Mr. Cohen testified that Mr. Trump in 2016 had personally directed him to pay off a porn star and had ap- proved a dubious reimbursement plan. \n# \n“Just do it,” the former fixer re- called Mr. Trump saying about the hush-money payment to the porn star, Stormy Daniels. \nWith the photos from the jew- elry ads in hand, The Times set out to understand why they at- tracted an unwanted audience. Test ads run by The Times using the same photos with no text not only replicated the merchant’s ex- perience — they drew the atten- tion of convicted sex offenders and other men whose accounts in- dicated a sexual interest in chil- dren or who wrote sexual mes- sages. \nMonday was the country’s first Memorial Day since the Oct. 7 attacks.

Security officials trailed journalists and people they sus- pected  of  immoral  behavior. Agents got criticism removed from social media and discussed ways to defame political adver- saries. Political protests were viewed as threats to be under- mined. \n# \n# \n# \nJERUSALEM — The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has for years overseen a secret police force in Gaza that conducted surveillance on everyday Palestinians and built files on young people, jour- nalists and those who questioned the government, according to in- telligence officials and a trove of internal documents reviewed by The New York Times. \nOver nearly five hours of testi- mony, Mr. Cohen painted a damn- ing portrait of his relationship with Mr. Trump, decoded their shady vernacular and spotlighted the conduct at the center of the first criminal trial of an American president: the silencing of women who had stories of sex with Mr. Trump to tell and to sell. \nThe Times opened two Insta- gram accounts and promoted posts showing the 5-year-old girl, her face turned away from the camera, wearing a tank top and the charm. Separate posts showed the clothing and jewelry without the child model, or with a black box concealing her. All of the paid ads were promoted to people in- terested in topics like childhood, dance and cheerleading, which Meta’s audience tools estimated \n# \nDonald J. Trump leads Presi- dent Biden in five crucial battle- ground states, a new set of polls shows, as a yearning for change and discontent over the economy and the war in Gaza among young, Black and Hispanic voters threaten to unravel the presi- dent’s Democratic coalition. The surveys by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was ahead among reg- istered voters in a head-to-head matchup against Mr. Biden in five of six key states: Michigan, Ari- zona, Nevada, Georgia and Penn- sylvania. Mr. Biden led among registered voters in only one bat- tleground state, Wisconsin. The race was closer among likely voters. Mr. Trump led in five states as well, but Mr. Biden edged ahead in Michigan while trailing only narrowly in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. While Mr. Biden won all six of those states in 2020, victories in Pennsylvania, Michi- gan and Wisconsin would be enough for him to win re-election, provided he won everywhere else he did four years ago. The results were similar in a hy- pothetical matchup that included minor-party candidates and the independent candidate Robert F .

Hamas has long run an oppres- sive system of governance in Gaza, and many Palestinians there know that security officials watch them closely. But a 62-slide presentation on the activities of the General Security Service, de- livered only weeks before the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, reveals the de- gree to which the largely un- known unit penetrated the lives of Palestinians. \nEveryday Gazans were stuck — behind the wall of Israel’s crip- pling blockade and under the thumb and constant watch of a se- curity force. That dilemma contin- ues today, with the added threat of Israeli  ground  troops  and airstrikes. \nMr. Cohen’s star turn was the climax of the prosecutors’ case as they formally introduced the jury to a witness who has loomed over the trial and could trigger the for- mer president’s downfall. He brought the case’s architecture into focus, offering firsthand cor- roboration of what jurors have heard from other witnesses. He also wove a sprawling cast of  Continued on Page A16 \nThe unit, known as the General Security Service, relied on a net- work of Gaza informants, some of whom reported their own neigh- bors to the police.

Dozens of flashlights snapped on, their beams crisscrossing crazily, seeking the source of the sound. The shafts of light homed in on a spectral figure — a slim, dark- haired woman dressed in white, moving at a funereal pace and plaintively singing. In the audi- ence, 130-odd children, ages 8 to 10, let loose squeals, some gasps, and one “it’s not real.” Several called out “Emma, Emma.” The children had just been told that the Costanzi, the capital’s opera house, had a resident phan- tom. No, not that one. This was said to be the spirit of Emma Carelli, an Italian soprano who managed the theater a century ago, and loved it so much that she was loath to leave it, even in death. “The theater is a place where strange things happen, where what is impossible becomes possi- ble,” Francesco Giambrone, the Costanzi’s general manager, told the children Saturday afternoon when they arrived to participate in  a  get-to-know-the-theater- sleepover. \nDonald J.

Much like Donald J. Trump, with whom he is often compared — with whom he often compares himself — Mr. Justice has faced a barrage of costly judgments and legal setbacks. \nMr. Giambrone said in an inter- view.
