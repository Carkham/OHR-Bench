Trying to pla cate both his far-right allies, who seek to rebuild Israeli settlements in Gaza,and Israel'sforeign part- ners,who want Gaza returned to Palestinian governance, Mr. Ne tanya hu has stopped short of any specific declaration. \n\"I'mreallynervous,\"Hope Hicks, the onetime Trump spokes- woman, messaging maestro and all-aroundadviser,acknowledged to the prosecutor questioning her, declaringwhatwasalreadyobvi- o us to the riveted courtroom.
