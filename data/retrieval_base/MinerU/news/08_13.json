But the number could have \n# \nWithout heat adaptation meas- ures over the past two decades, the death toll for Europeans expe- riencing the same temperatures at the start of the 21st century could have been 80 percent higher, according to the new study. For people over 80 years old, the toll could have doubled. Some of the measures include advances in health care, more widespread air-conditioning and improved public information that kept people indoors and hydrated amid extreme temperatures. \nWhen she signed on to be direc- tor of elections in Cobb County, Ga., last year, she knew she’d be registering voters and recruiting poll workers, maybe fixing up vot- ing machines. \nShe didn’t expect the unending flood of disinformation — or at least, she wasn’t prepared for how much it would overtake her job. She has had election deniers shout at her at public meetings, fielded weekend calls from politicians panicked about a newly circulat- ing falsehood, and even reviewed conspiracy theories circulating on Nextdoor forums that might wors- en skepticism among distrustful constituents already doubtful that the democratic system is reliable and secure. \n“We need to consider climate change as a health issue,” said Elisa Gallo, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral re- searcher at the Barcelona Insti- tute for Global Health, a nonprofit research center. “We still have thousands of deaths caused by heat every year, so we still have to work a lot, and we have to work faster.” \n# \nUkrainian vehicles passing a sign pointing to Ukraine (left) and Russia (right) at the Sudzha border crossing on Monday.

Trump was tar- geted in an assassination attempt and Kamala Harris replaced Pres- ident Biden as the Democratic nominee, adding Tim Walz to the ticket, conspiracy theories have surged. The claims were pushed by pundits and politicians like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican known for promoting far-right conspiracy theories, who represents part of Ms. Fall’s jurisdiction. \nCounting deaths from extreme heat is difficult, in part because death certificates don’t always re- flect the role of heat. The study used publicly available death records from 35 countries, pro- vided by Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union, and representing about 543 million Europeans. \nyears, or have been married to a U.S. citizen for at least three years. \n# \n# \nSAVANNAH, Ga. — The fed-eral government is processing cit- izenship requests at the fastest clip in a decade, moving rapidly through a backlog that built up during the Trump administration and the coronavirus pandemic. At ceremonies in courthouses, convention centers and sports arenas across the country, thou- sands of immigrants are becom- ing new Americans every week — and becoming eligible to vote in time for the presidential election this fall. \nGreen-card holders have many of the same rights as citizens. But voting in federal elections is a right accorded only to citizens. And that can be a powerful moti- vation to pursue citizenship, espe- cially when big national elections are on the horizon. \n# \nWASHINGTON — Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris and her run- ning mate, Tim Walz, the Minne- sota governor, have quickly made the Affordable Care Act central to their  campaign,  raising  the specter of another Republican re- peal effort next year if former President Donald J. Trump wins \nGeorgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \nThe researchers used an epide- miological model to analyze the deaths alongside 2023 weekly temperature records to estimate what fraction of deaths could be attributable to heat. \nIn Savannah, Ga., people from 19 countries streamed into a fed- eral courthouse recently to take the oath of allegiance. \nThe implications for Ms. Fall’s workload will not be good, she said, noting that conspiracy theo- ries can make it harder to reach constituents who already find elections to be mystifying, like “magical” events. \n“My case was done in less than six months,” said Gladis Brown, who is married to an American and emigrated from Honduras in 2018. \n“We’re quickly approaching the limits to what the human body can withstand,” said Jordan Clark, a senior policy associate at Duke University’s Heat Policy Innova- tion Hub who was not involved in the study. As the planet continues to warm, he said, “we’re racing against the clock.” \nwant to vote in the election.” After the ceremony, Ms. Brown celebrated with cake and punch from a local women’s volunteer group — and by completing a vot- er-registration form provided by a representative of the League of Women Voters. \n“If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions,” Ms. Har- ris said at a rally in Philadelphia last week as she introduced Mr. Walz as her running mate. “You remember what that was like?” The next day, Mr. Walz said at a rally in Detroit that Mr. Trump would continue trying to under- mine the 2010 health law because “he doesn’t care.” But so far they are battling an opponent without a position. Missing from the campaign this year is an organized effort against the Affordable Care Act by Repub- licans, who have tried and failed repeatedly to repeal the law.
