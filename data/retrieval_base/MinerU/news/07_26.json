Her fund-raisers, armed with a new Harris logo, went to work. \nVice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with for- mer President Donald J. Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly re- uniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden. \nMajor fund-raisers — one of whom told President Biden’s cam- paign just days ago that he thought the campaign could count on only about 25 percent of its al- lied donors to support Mr. Biden — are now swamped with a flood of interest from donors. Ms. Harris has no time to waste, having taken over the top of the Democratic ticket with just over 100 days to go and without the years of lead time that Mr. Biden had to cultivate major donors, soothe them and coax them to hand over their money. Harris campaign officials spent Tuesday and Wednesday energiz- ing their supporters from Beverly Hills to the Hamptons. \nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the pre- sumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more com- petitive and drawn-out process. Her swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump’s signifi- cant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans. \n# \n# \nThe merrymaking had a head start on Wednesday, two days be- fore the opening ceremony, with the Games’ soft opening: a small slate of soccer and rugby matches around the country. \n# \n# \nPARIS — Tara Davis-Woodhall, a long jumper by trade and an en- tertainer at heart, gazed into the stands at Tokyo’s 68,000-seat Olympic stadium and decided she needed some noise. In a quixotic bid to inject even a small dose of spirit into a pandemic-stricken Summer Games, she began clap- ping her hands theatrically. Tens of people, give or take, \nOn Wednesday, about 40 high- powered finance and Big Law ex- ecutives joined a Zoom call orga- nized by the superlawyer Brad Karp, the former New York City mayoral candidate Ray McGuire and a few others to discuss how Wall Street could best support a Harris ticket. Speakers included Rufus Gifford, the campaign’s fi- nance chair, and donors inquired about Ms. Harris’s position on Is- rael, her posture on the economy and her selection of a running mate, according to two people on the call. \n# \nOverall, Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in a head-to- head match. That is a marked im- provement for Democrats when compared to the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Mr. Bi- den behind by six percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventu- ally drove him from the race. Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 46 percent among reg- istered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percent- \n# \nIt was merely an appetizer, but in a single sun-splashed afternoon at the Stade de France, just north of the capital, the Paris Games be- came  everything  the  Tokyo Olympics were not. \ncial partners and fans. “The tone is completely differ- ent,” said Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We now have per- mission to have fun.” \nSACRAMENTO — Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered California state officials on Thursday to begin dis- mantling thousands of homeless encampments, the nation’s most sweeping response to a recent Su- preme Court ruling that gave gov- ernments greater authority to re- move homeless people from their streets. \nThe stands at the Stade de France were jammed with fans for an early round of rugby sevens on Wednesday at the Paris Games. \n“It was awful,” Davis-Woodhall said last month about the enforced emptiness of the Olympics three summers ago. “It was my first Olympics, and I was like, ‘What the heck? This is weird!’ I’m glad it’s over, and I’m glad that I’m go- ing to Paris to actually experience an Olympics.” \nMore than in any other state, homeless  encampments  have been a wrenching issue in Califor- nia, where housing costs are among the nation’s highest, com- plicating the many other factors that contribute to homelessness. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, and most of them were unshel- tered. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, called on state officials and local leaders to “humanely remove en- campments from public spaces” and act “with urgency,” prioritiz- ing those that most threaten health and safety. \nIn Hollywood, Harris campaign officials joined calls on Tuesday and Wednesday with people from across the creative and entertain- ment industry to talk about fund- raising and organize celebrities on behalf of the Harris campaign, according to two people with knowledge of the outreach. “Donors are calling asking how and where can I contribute to Har- ris for President,” said Andy Spahn, a top fund-raiser in Holly- wood. He added that there was “tremendous excitement and en- thusiasm for Kamala’s candidacy here.” \nThe survey provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the mid- dle of one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in modern American history. Democrats sud- denly have a new nominee. And, less than two weeks after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt, his favorability rating rose to the highest level it has ever been in a national New York Times survey. \nCountless athletes like Davis- Woodhall — those who have com- peted in an Olympics but not truly experienced one — have arrived in Paris this month in search of the \nBecause  normalcy,  at  the Olympics, is grandeur.
