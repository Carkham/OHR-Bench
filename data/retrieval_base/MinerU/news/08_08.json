No. 60,240 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 2024 \n# \nThe emergence of the 11-year-old skateboarder Zheng Haohao, known as Lilibet, has signaled a shift in the Chinese sports machine. \n# \nSelection by Harris Offers a Contrast on the Ballot \n# \n# \nIn selecting Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris has picked a partner who is many things she is not: a prod- \nST. PAUL, Minn. — Tim Walz never attended an Ivy League school. He never wrote a political memoir. He once worked at a tan- ning bed factory in Jonesboro, Ark. And until he was 40, he never showed much interest in a career in politics. \nNEWS America. A union ANALYSIS member known to campaign in a \nT-shirt and camo hat. A white guy who exudes Midwestern dad energy. \nMr. Walz, the 60-year-old gover- nor of Minnesota chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate on Tuesday, had not devoted his life to reaching this pinnacle. \nAnd, perhaps most important, a politician who has had to rely on the support of independent, or even Republican, voters to win elections. \nIn selecting Mr. Walz, Ms. Har- ris has picked a one-man rejoinder to the idea that the Democrats are the party of the cultural and coast- al elite. His biography and his style are a sharp contrast not only to Ms. Harris, who is from Califor- \nTheir pairing is somewhat predictable; a cardinal rule of vice-presidential selection is to construct the ticket with political balance in mind. But it is also a statement about what many Democrats believe is one of Ms. Harris’s key vulnerabilities: that she is perceived as too liberal, putting even the small slice of rural, working-class and moder- ate voters that she needs across Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan out of her reach. Ms. Harris, a California Demo- crat, has never won an election as a solo candidate outside the liberal bastion of California, where races often hinge not on winning swing voters but on successfully navigating intra- party fights. That has left her with limited experience acquir- ing a political skill Mr. Walz honed over his nearly two dec- ades in politics: talking to con- \n\n# \n# \n“I don’t want to put any pres- sure on myself,” Lilibet wrote on Chinese social media before her competition. “I just want to show my best in Paris.” \n# \n# \nPARIS — Lilibet speaks good English. Her coach is British and amply tattooed. She competed on Tuesday in park skateboarding, an insurgent sport in which the point among the sisterhood of ath- letes is not just winning a medal but embodying a mantra of female empowerment. \nLilibet’s carefree attitude, an energy tonic for Chinese fans at these Games, has prompted ques- tions of whether it’s worth push- ing Chinese athletes so hard for national glory. \n# \nCARACAS, Venezuela — For the Venezuelan government, ev- erything seemed to be falling in place. \nGov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has displayed shrewd instincts. \nades has harnessed tens of thou- sands of small children in hopes of forging a tiny fraction of them into Olympic champions. Yet Lilibet’s debut, along with those of a few other Chinese Olympians, has come in large part because she has grown up outside the state’s full embrace. \nIn Paris, China is once again locked in a gold-medal race with the United States — a contest that probably means more to Beijing than to Washington. As expected,  Continued on Page A9 \nnia, but also to former President Donald J. Trump, a New York bil- lionaire, and to some degree to Mr. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School (and wrote a best-selling memoir). \nLilibet is just a nickname. Her full name is Zheng Haohao, and at 11 she is the youngest athlete at the Olympic Games. She is also the new face of a Chinese sports- industrial complex that for dec- \nFrancisco Torrealba, a senior ruling party official, described be- ing in an electoral command cen- ter in the country’s capital, Cara- cas, on Election Day last month, watching the computer monitors with confidence as the presiden- tial vote neared its close. \nThe great dream of Ms. Har- ris’s pick is that Mr. Walz’s brand of affable cultural politics can help broaden her appeal and win back some of the voters who have been fleeing the party for years. \nMr. Walz has led a life that stands out in the top echelon of American politics: a tableau filled with scenes of farming, turkey hunting, weekends of National Guard duty, public schools and coaching the local high school football team to a state champi- onship. \n\nIn other words, Democrats hope that “Brat summer,” the lime green, pop-culture meme for Ms. Harris’s campaign, can translate into the kind of brat summer that evokes a staple of Midwest barbecues. \nThe picture was much the same in other traditional government strongholds nationwide, he said. This assured officials that a com- bination of high turnout among loyalists and suppressing the vote for the opposition would propel Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, to a presidential election victory. \nSince turning to politics, Mr. Walz has used this biography to his political advantage, and it was no small part of what drew Ms. Harris to Mr. Walz, who until weeks ago was virtually unknown to most Democrats. With his broad smile and unpolished style, it was the Minnesota governor — more than any other Democrat — who was able to conceive and de- liver Democrats’ new favorite at- tack on Mr. Trump and his party:  \n“This is a man who is as com- fortable walking into Farm Fest in southern Minnesota and talk- ing to corn and soybean growers as he is walking into a Black church in north Minneapolis,” said Senator Tina Smith, the Minnesota Democrat. “He is a person who just knows how to sit down and listen and connect with people .” \n“We were calm,” Mr. Torrealba, a veteran lawmaker and a senior official of the ruling Socialist Party, said in an interview, de- scribing the mood among govern- ment officials during the July 28 vote. “We did everything neces- sary to achieve a good victory.” \nBut Republicans are not going to let Mr. Walz’s casual style and  Continued on Page A14 \nVote tallies showed that the rul- ing party’s supporters in the pub- lic sector and poor neighborhoods had abandoned the country’s leader in droves, according to vote tallies obtained by the opposition. An electoral disaster loomed. “We were betrayed, because \n# \n# \n# \nthey said they were going to vote for Maduro and what did they do? \nFirst it was a tax cut for hotel and restaurant workers in Neva- da, a swing state where Donald J. Trump proposed exempting tips from taxes. Then, in front of pow- erful chief executives gathered in Washington, Mr. Trump floated cutting the corporate tax rate, helping to ease concerns in the business community about his candidacy. \nlies, and without formal policy proposals, Mr. Trump has casually suggested reducing federal reve- nue by trillions of dollars. While policy experts have taken issue with the ideas, Mr. Trump’s pronouncements have real politi- cal appeal, at times putting Demo- crats on their back foot. Nevada’s two Democratic senators and its powerful culinary union have en- dorsed ending taxes on tips. The AARP supports tax relief for sen- iors receiving Social Security benefits, though it has not taken a position on Mr. Trump’s proposal. “You do have to scratch your head a little bit when someone’s going  around  offering  free lunches everywhere,” said Jesse Lee, a Democratic consultant and former Biden White House offi- Continued on Page A15 \nThis generation will probably see the demise of the largest coral reef system in the world unless humanity acts with far more urgency to rein in climate change, new research suggests.

Already, some consumers, es- pecially those with lower incomes, are feeling the dual pinch of higher prices and elevated inter- est rates that are weighing on their finances. Credit card delin- quencies are rising, and house- hold debt has swelled. Pandemic- era savings have dwindled.

In July, there was a notable slowdown in hiring and a jump in the unem- ployment rate to its highest level since October 2021, but consumer spending has remained relatively robust. Wages are rising, though at a slower rate, and job cuts are still low. \nNow Mr. Trump is calling for an end to taxing Social Security benefits, which could be a boon for retirees, one of the most politically important groups in the United States. \nThe  economy’s  resurgence from the pandemic shock has had a singular driving force: the con- sumer.
