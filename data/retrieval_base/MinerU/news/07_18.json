No. 60,219 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nTHURSDAY, JULY 18, 2024 \n# \nAfter an Attack The collapsed minaret of a mosque following heavy bombardment by Israeli forces in Nuseirat, in the central part of the Gaza Strip. \nFormer Critic Spent Years Winning Favor \n# \nThe meeting got off to a bad exactly the people Mr. Vance pur- start. ported to represent. \nAt that point, Mr. Trump seemed disarmed, and the meet- ing went on for almost two hours. They discussed the 2020 election and the Ohio race, but mostly they talked about the difficulties of politics. It had been less than a month since Mr. Trump left the White House a pariah, in the wake of a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol after the president had spent two months lying about a stolen election. \nJ.D. Vance walked into Donald J. Trump’s office at Mar-a-Lago on a warm winter afternoon in Feb- ruary 2021. The former president had a thick stack of papers on his desk: printouts of Mr. Vance’s co- pious broadsides against Mr. Trump. Mr. Vance’s past criti- cisms had included an essay in one of Mr. Trump’s least favorite magazines, The Atlantic, where Mr. Vance described Mr. Trump as “cultural heroin” — a purveyor of false promises to the white work- ing class. \nMr. Trump closed the conversa- tion by asking Mr. Vance what he wanted. Mr. Trump told him that everyone else had already been down to Mar-a-Lago begging for his endorsement — a reference to Mr. Vance’s potential opponents in the Ohio Senate primary. \nMr. Trump, using an expletive, bluntly told Mr. Vance: You said some nasty stuff about me. The discussion that followed was de- scribed in detail by two people with knowledge of the meeting who insisted on anonymity to talk about a private conversation. Mr. Vance’s next move was cru- cial. This was the first time he was meeting Mr. Trump, and Mr. Vance needed the former presi- dent to like him or at least leave the meeting with an open mind. Mr. Vance — the author of “Hill- billy Elegy,” a best-selling memoir about his troubled upbringing and the struggles and pathologies of the white working class — was running for the open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican popu- list, a Never Trumper turned pro- Trumper. \nMr. Vance, who along with a spokesman for Mr. Trump de- clined to comment for this article, told the former president he was- n’t going to do that. \nMr. Vance said that of course he wanted it, but that Mr. Trump  \n# \nContinued on Page A12 \n# \n\nmade it easier to transplant adult stem cells. And the few parents who try to withdraw cord blood samples often find that they are unusable — either because their volume is too low or they have been  contaminated  with  mi- crobes. \n# \n# \nMillions of pregnant women get the pitch through their OB-GYN: Put a bit of your newborn’s umbili- cal cord on ice, as a biological in- surance policy. If your child one day faces cancer, diabetes or even autism, the precious stem cells in the cord blood could become a tai- lor-made cure. \nMr. Vance decided to immedi- ately apologize. He told Mr. Trump that he had bought into what he described as media lies and that he was sorry he got it wrong. Of all people, Mr. Vance told Mr. Trump, Mr. Vance himself should have un- derstood. \nInquiry Finds Blind Spot in Critical Minutes \nthereafter.  The  industry  has grown rapidly, bolstered by in- vestments from medical device companies, hospital partnerships and endorsements from celebri- ties like Drew Barrymore and Chrissy Teigen. \nWhen the first cord blood banks opened three decades ago, doc- tors were optimistic about turning the stem cells, otherwise dis- carded as medical waste, into a powerful new treatment for pa- tients with leukemia and other blood disorders. Private banks promised peace of mind for anx- ious parents-to-be, knowing the cells would be ready and waiting if their child ever got sick. Continued on Page A19 \nThis article is by  David A. Fahr- enthold ,  Glenn Thrush ,  Campbell Robertson ,  Adam Goldman  and Aric Toler . \nMr. Trump agreed, telling Mr. Vance that he should have under- stood because Mr. Vance had writ- ten the “Hillbilly Elegy” book. His implication was that Mr. Vance should have supported him be- cause Mr. Trump’s own base of non-college-educated voters an- gry about globalization, immigra- tion and foreign wars comprised \nMany families are happy to pay for the assurance of a healthy fu- ture. More than two million umbil- ical cord samples sit in a handful of suburban warehouses across the country.

Then they lost track of him. \nDemocrats’ rebellion against President Biden intensified on Wednesday with the party’s con- gressional leaders lobbying suc- cessfully to delay his nomination by a week, prolonging the debate over the viability of his candidacy. The maneuver came as Repre- sentative Adam B. Schiff of Cali- fornia became the highest-profile Democratic lawmaker to call on Mr. Biden to end his run. \nBUTLER, Pa. — Before Satur- day, when Butler became the lat- est stunned backdrop for the na- tion’s political fury, Mayor Bob Dandoy thought of his town as a place that had learned to work around party lines. A Democrat in a Republican stronghold, he had campaigned on consensus. \nTwenty minutes before violence erupted, a sniper, from a distance, spotted Mr. Crooks again and took his picture. \nAs time slipped away, at least two local officers were pulled from traffic detail to help search for the man. But the Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting Mr. Trump, did not stop him from taking the stage. Eight minutes af- ter Mr. Trump started to speak, Mr. Crooks fired off bullets that left the Republican presidential nominee bloodied and a rally vis- itor dead. \n“I’ve never seen a Republican or Democratic pothole,” Mr. Dan- doy, 71, a retired high school Eng- lish teacher, would tell voters. “Or a Republican or Democratic play- ground. Or a Republican or Demo- cratic fire that the fire department needs to put out.” \nAfter a brief pause in the after- math of the assassination attempt on former President Donald J. Trump,  conversations  among Democrats on Capitol Hill and elsewhere about replacing Mr. Bi- den at the top of the ticket have re- sumed with vigor. More details have emerged of heated conversa- tions the president has held with lawmakers in which he has an- grily pushed back on their en- treaties for him to drop out of the race. \nHe was at dinner with his family on Saturday when a city council- man texted. One spectator was dead at Donald J. Trump’s cam- paign rally on the farm show grounds, two more were critically injured. The former president’s right ear had been grazed by a bullet. The gunman, an isolated 20-year-old with an AR-15-style ri- fle, was fatally shot by the Secret Service. All this in the town of about 13,000 people where Mr. Dandoy has lived “all my life.” \nThe call to let the proceedings go on as planned while law en- forcement looked for a suspicious person is one of many Secret Serv- ice agency decisions that are now being called into question as new information continues to be re- vealed. The agency is also under fire for allowing a building within a rifle’s range to be excluded from its secure perimeter, creating a blind spot close to the former president that the gunman ex- ploited. \n# \ntrain delays and breakdowns are becoming more frequent as Amer- ica’s antiquated rail infrastructure struggles to remain functional during  prolonged  extreme weather events that were not typi- cal when the system was con- structed. \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — On June 20, after millions of Americans had suffered through a sweltering heat wave for three days, Amtrak sent an ominous warning over so- cial media: Trains connecting the largest cities in Northeast could face up to an hour of delay from high temperatures.
