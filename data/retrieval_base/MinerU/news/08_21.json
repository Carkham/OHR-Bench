Regulator of Health Devices Whose Wife Represented Their Makers \n# \nFor 15 years, Dr. Jeffrey E. Shuren was the federal official charged with ensuring the safety of a vast array of medical devices including artificial knees, breast implants and Covid tests. \nmakers as the co-leader of a team of lawyers at Arnold & Porter, one of Washington’s most powerful law firms. \nDr. Shuren signed ethics agree- ments obtained by The New York Times that were meant to wall him off from matters involving Arnold & Porter’s business. But it’s not clear how rigorously the ethics agreements were actually en- forced. His wife’s law firm refused to provide a list of clients — and the agency had no legal authority to require it, said Michael Felber- baum, a spokesman for the F.D.A. In a review of thousands of pages of court documents and F .D.A. records and dozens of inter- views with current and former agency staff members and advo- cates, The Times identified some clients and several instances in which the Shurens’ roles inter- sected. \nWhen he announced in July that he would be retiring from the Food and Drug Administration later this year, Dr. Robert Califf, the agency’s commissioner, praised him for overseeing the approval of more novel devices last year than ever before in the nearly half-cen- tury history of the device division. But the admiration for Dr. Shuren is far from universal. Con- sumer advocates see his tenure as marred by the approval of too many devices that harmed pa- tients and by his own close ties to the \\$500 billion global device in- dustry. \nOne connection stood out: While Dr. Shuren regulated the booming medical device industry, his wife, Allison W. Shuren, repre- sented the interests of device \nHer partner at the helm of the firm’s life sciences team began representing Theranos, the dis- credited blood testing company, in 2015, demanding that the F.D.A. halt an inspection at its sites in California. While Dr. Shuren said he was recused from the matter, court records suggested he re- mained involved. In another case, Ms. Shuren’s firm was working on a \\$63 billion acquisition of the company Al- lergan in 2019 when Dr. Shuren initially declined to urge a recall of the company’s breast implants tied to a rare cancer. \n# \nDelegates at the Democratic National Convention saluted President Biden for his decades of service while welcoming Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket.

Someone chalked a slur on his driveway in giant letters. His mother recalled being horrified by anonymous mail that arrived at their home, including one mes- sage that said her gay son would be better off dead.

She had flown to Iowa for the first time, touching down in Des Moines during one of the wettest winters on record. \nThat early chapter from Mr. Walz’s teaching years helped shape his stances as a politician and reflects how much Mr. Walz’s partnership with his wife, Gwen, has shaped his work over many years. Heavily influenced by Ms. Walz, who was Mr. Reitan’s teacher and someone the student confided in, Mr. Walz went on to make gay rights a signature issue  Continued on Page A14 \ncloset and sought their support to start a gay-straight alliance club. The principal made an uncon- ventional decision in the choice of a faculty adviser for the club, which the high school had never had before in this relatively con- servative city: Tim Walz, a geog- raphy teacher who was also a foot- ball coach. Mr. Walz readily agreed, and the choice came as a relief to Mr. Reitan. \n# \n# \nMs. Harris turned up in a dingy campaign field office, wearing a puffy coat and boots. Near a tan- gle of power cords, someone had propped an “African Americans for Obama” poster against a wall. In the midst of that bleak Mid- western winter, Ms. Harris was there to knock on doors for Barack Obama, the junior senator from Il- linois mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency. \n# \n# \nPresident Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, re- orients America’s deterrent strat- egy to focus on China’s rapid ex- pansion in its nuclear arsenal. \nCarlos Magdalena, “the plant messiah,” with giant Amazon water lilies at Kew Gardens in London. \nhave visited Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., every year since 2015. To them, the theme park feels like an oasis where they can escape the stress of everyday life. So when their son, Lincoln, was born in 2020, Ms. Leach wanted his first visit to the park to be spe- cial and spared no expense in planning it. She booked a two- week trip to visit Florida in De- cember 2022, which included stays at Disney World and Univer- sal Studios. \n“To be here is worth 1,000 Champagne bottles and firecrack- ers,” Ms. Harris told a reporter on New Year’s Day, surrounded by campaign detritus. “It’s equal to that, in terms of the thrill, the ex- citement and the promise for to- morrow.” \nThe shift comes as the Penta- gon believes China’s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States’ and Russia’s over the next decade. \nThe White House never an- nounced that Mr. Biden had ap- proved the revised strategy, called the Nuclear Employment Guid- ance, which also newly seeks to prepare the United States for pos- sible coordinated nuclear chal- lenges from China, Russia and North Korea. The document, up- dated every four years or so, is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of hard copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. \nSupporting Mr. Obama was a political risk. Ms. Harris was one of the rare Californians holding elected office — and one of few in the Democratic Party writ large — to endorse him for the presidency. Most of the party’s institutional heft had been thrown behind Hil- lary Clinton, a senator from New York who had a powerful surro- gate in her husband, former Presi- dent Bill Clinton. \nThe costs quickly accumulated. Ms. Leach and her family traveled from New Haven, Conn., and paid extra for admission to “Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party,” an after-hours event that cost about \\$200 per person. She also shelled out \\$100 for the theme park’s photo service so she could down- load photos of the family that pho- tographers took during the visit. The  vacation  cost  around \nBut Ms. Harris’s early bet paid off, and Mr. Obama has never for- gotten it. \n\\$6,000, which included accommo- dations, tickets and a car rental, and which Ms. Leach charged to her Disney-branded credit card. \nBut in recent speeches, two sen- ior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change — in carefully constrained, single sentences — ahead of a more de- tailed, unclassified notification to Congress expected before Mr. Bi- den leaves office. \n“She was just a rock-solid sup- porter of the president at a time the entire political establishment was not with him,” said Buffy Wicks, a California State Assem- bly member who was the 32nd person hired by Mr. Obama’s cam- paign. “She set aside significant time and energy to help get him elected, and that was greatly ap- preciated by him.” \nMs. Leach is one of many par- ents who have taken on debt for a Disney family vacation. In June, LendingTree, a financial firm, published the results of a survey of over 2,000 people that found that 45 percent of parents with children under 18 who have gone to Disney went into debt for the trip. \n# \n# \n“The president recently issued updated nuclear-weapons em- ployment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversar- ies,” Vipin Narang, an M.I.T. nu- clear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month before returning to academia. “And in particular,” he added, the weapons guidance accounted for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nu- clear arsenal. \nknown as “the plant messiah,” as anointed by a Spanish newspa- per in 2010, for his work rescuing several plant species from the brink of extinction.
