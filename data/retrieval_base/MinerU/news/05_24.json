Carolina \nLooting Complicates Delivery of Supplies \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court cleared the way on Thursday for South Carolina to keep using a congressional map that a lower court had deemed an unconstitutional racial gerryman- der that resulted in the “bleaching of African American voters” from a district. \n# \nWASHINGTON — In the week since the U.S. military and allies attached a temporary pier to the Gaza shoreline, Pentagon plan- ners have come face to face with the logistical nightmare that critics had warned would accom- pany the endeavor. \nThe conservative majority, by a 6-to-3 vote, returned the case to the lower court, handing a victory to Republicans by allowing them to  maintain  boundaries  that helped make the district in ques- tion a party stronghold. \npredicted that a steady stream of humanitarian aid would be arriv- ing in Gaza via the pier by now, but little relief has reached Pales- tinians in the besieged strip, officials acknowledged this week. Several trucks were looted as they made their way to a ware- house, the U.N. World Food Pro- gram said, and the complexity of operating the pier project in a war zone is continuing to slow distribution. \nThe immediate effect of the rul- ing will be limited, as the court’s delay in ruling had already en- sured that this year’s elections would take place under the con- tested map. But the majority opin- ion, written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., will have an impact be- yond South Carolina in the years to come, said Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. \nThe problems, as expected, are on the back end of the operation. Looting of aid trucks has contin- ued, officials said, and forced the World Food Program to suspend operations for two days. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, suspended food distri- bution in Rafah on Tuesday, citing lack of security. It added that it had not received any medical supplies for 10 days because of closures and disrup- tions at the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings. \n“Justice Alito for a court major- ity has once again come up with a legal framework that makes it easier for Republican states to en- gage in redistricting to help white Republicans maximize their polit- \n# \n# \nages for racial trauma. The city apologized for its role and said it was committed to pursuing a reparations program. But negoti- ations stalled. \nical power,” Professor Hasen said. The ruling was the latest in a se- ries of closely divided decisions on elections that characterize the work of the court led by Chief Jus- tice John G. Roberts Jr., including ones that have amplified the role of money in politics, made it easier to restrict voting and exempted partisan gerrymandering from re- view in federal court. \n# \n# \nPALM SPRINGS, Calif. — The billboards rise above the desert valley, introducing millions of vis- itors to what was an almost forgot- ten chapter in Palm Springs his- tory. “Know before you go. Palm Springs Section 14,” one billboard reads. “We smelled the smoke, we watched our houses burn.” \nCalifornia is at the forefront of the movement to compensate Af- rican Americans who have been harmed by systemic racism and the legacy of slavery, but the expe- rience in Palm Springs under- scores the challenges of broad- ening largely symbolic support to concrete actions. Last year, a state panel recommended dozens of policy changes and billions of dol- lars in reparations to the state’s Black residents. State lawmakers have acted on some of that guid- Continued on Page A18 \n# \nThe project was always ex- pected to be difficult.

A convention center, ho- tels and a casino now dominate the landscape. \nWASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Thursday sued Live Nation Entertainment, the concert giant that owns Ticket- master, asking a court to break up the company over claims it ille- gally maintained a monopoly in the live entertainment industry. In the lawsuit, which is joined by 29 states and the District of Co- lumbia, the government accuses Live Nation of leveraging its sprawling empire to dominate the industry by locking venues into exclusive  ticketing  contracts, pressuring artists to use its serv- ices and threatening its rivals with financial retribution. \nThe trend is not entirely uni- form, as the court ruled last year that Alabama lawmakers had di- luted the power of Black voters in drawing a congressional voting map. But the overall pattern has been to limit the oversight of elec- tions by Congress and the federal courts, often in ways that have  \nIn the 1960s, in Palm Springs, a sun-drenched resort destination in Southern California, a neigh- borhood of mostly Black and Lati- no families was razed to make room for commercial develop- ment.

That’s why it’s ripe for disruption. \n\nThose tactics, the government argues, have resulted in higher ticket prices for consumers and have stifled innovation and com- petition throughout the industry. The suit asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to order “the divesti- ture of, at minimum, Ticketmas- ter,” and to prevent Live Nation from engaging in anticompetitive practices. \n“It is time for fans and artists to stop paying the price for Live Na- tion’s monopoly,” Merrick B.

The assault shut down Change’s digital billing and payment routes, leaving hos- pitals, doctors and pharmacists without ways to communicate with health insurers for weeks.

If commencement is ripe for contestation (the backs turned on the speaker, the kaf- fiyeh replacing the pointed sash), that’s because it’s one of the very last venues in which Americans show a commitment to  how  we do things, and not just what we say and record.
