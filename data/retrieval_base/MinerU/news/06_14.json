No. 60,185 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nFRIDAY, JUNE 14, 2024 \n# \n\n9-0 Decision on Procedural Grounds — Drug May Face Other Challenges \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court on Thursday main- tained access to a widely available abortion pill, rejecting a bid from a group of anti-abortion organiza- tions and doctors to undo the Food and Drug Administration’s ap- proval of the drug. \ntion since the court eliminated a constitutional right to the pro- cedure in Dobbs v. Jackson Wom- en’s Health Organization. (The bans do not distinguish between medication and surgical abor- tion.) \nAccess to abortion remains broadly popular, and ever since the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, prompting some states to swiftly enact bans, the is- sue has been a major focus of po- litical  campaigns.  Democrats \nIn a unanimous decision, writ- ten by Justice Brett M. Kava- naugh, the court held that the anti- abortion groups lacked a direct stake in the dispute, a require- ment to challenge the F .D.A.’s ap- proval of the pill, mifepristone. “The plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone,” Justice Kav- anaugh wrote. “And F.D.A. is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything.” He added, “A plaintiff’s desire to \n\nStorms Soak Southern Florida Storms deluged part of the state, including Hallandale Beach, above, as a rainy season has become more unpredictable.

But by the time it reached the Supreme Court, the question had been narrowed to whether the agency had acted le- gally in 2016 and 2021, when it broadened distribution of the pill, eventually including telemedicine and mail options. \n# \n# \nThe mifepristone ruling gave a muted victory to rights groups. \nthought a deal could be reached, President Biden said, “I haven’t lost hope, but it’s going to be tough.” \n# \n# \nJERUSALEM — Prime Min- ister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel called Hamas’s response to the latest peace proposal for Gaza “negative.” Hamas insisted it was dealing with \nhave succeeded in galvanizing voters to defeat anti-abortion measures and plan to highlight abortion rights in the November elections. \nThe ruling handed a muted vic- tory to abortion rights groups. Even as they praised the decision for averting severe restrictions on the availability of the pill, they warned that the outcome could be short-lived. \nAt the crux of the disagree- ment over the three-phase deal, according to officials and ex- perts, is Hamas’s goal of essen- tially securing a permanent cease-fire from the outset and a withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza before handing over most of the hostages. \n# \nBy dodging a ruling on the sub- stance of the case, the justices avoided delivering a clear, sub- stantive win to either political party or a decision they could use to motivate their base. \nThe Biden administration has pledged to keep working with the Qatari and Egyptian mediators to bridge the gaps. But after days of intensive diplomacy in the region, a monthslong effort to end the war in Gaza seems as stuck as ever, as each side clings stubbornly to maximalist de- mands unacceptable to the other.

Blinken, speaking in Qatar, said Hamas had demanded changes, some of which were “workable” and some not. A Hamas official told an Arabic television channel that the group had not raised any new ideas and that Mr. Blinken saw things through an Israeli lens and “speaks Hebrew.” \nAnti-abortion groups vowed to press ahead, promising that the fight was far from over and raising the possibility that other plain- tiffs, states in particular, would mount challenges to the drug.

After the police officers had bagged and weighed the contraband and sent it off in an evidence van, a sheriff’s sergeant sealed the entrances to the store with padlocks. Similar scenes have played out across New York City as a task force led by the Sheriff’s Office has flexed its new emergency powers to lock down unlicensed cannabis shops, which officials re- cently estimated outnumbered li- censed retailers in the city by about 2,900 to 62. From May 7 to June 3, inspection teams closed 311 stores, seized \\$10.4 million worth of products and issued \\$23.4 million in fines, according to the mayor’s office. An additional 325 shops were put on notice. Previously, shuttered stores could reopen within hours of in- spections while officials sought court orders to shut them down permanently. But changes en- acted in this year’s state budget and the city code have given the Sheriff’s Office the power to de- clare the shops an imminent \n# \nWASHINGTON — When Presi- dent Biden made clear last year that he was planning to run for an- other term, some important Dem- ocratic contributors expressed doubt. He was too old, they feared. He was not up to another four years. \nIt fell to Jeffrey Katzenberg to tell them they were wrong. When some still did not believe him, Mr. Katzenberg challenged them to come to Washington and find out for themselves — then arranged to bring the dubious donors to the White House to sit down with the octogenarian president to con- vince them he was still sharp enough. \nLaylah Rose, the head of Miss USA, between Noelia Voigt, left, and UmaSofia Srivastava, who both quit after their wins. \nThose repairs were sorely needed. In recent years, Miss USA has weathered allegations of rac- ism and sexual harassment, and has passed from owner to owner — one of them being Donald J. Trump. The 2022 suicide of Miss USA 2019 sent the organization reeling. In 2023, Ms. Rose’s prede- cessor was suspended after accu- sations of pageant rigging. In her first months in charge of the pageant, Ms. Rose got to work.

Gavin Newsom of California, a longtime ally of Mr. Katzenberg, recounted in an inter- view. “And he started doing that in a consistent way.” In the end, Mr. Newsom added, “He really was in- strumental in getting people off the sidelines and getting them to dive headfirst in this campaign.” Few have dived headfirst into  Continued on Page A15 \n# \neach other when inspectors are nearby or shifting to delivery services — even reviving weed trucks — others have stopped sell- ing cannabis or shut down com- pletely, he said. “It’s not just the cost of doing business  anymore,”  he  said. \nimmediately for up to a year.
