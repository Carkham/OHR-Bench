In the coming months, this team of roughly 30 people at the Occu- pational Safety and Health Ad- ministration is expected to pro- pose a new rule that would require employers to protect an estimated 50 million people exposed to high temperatures while they work. They include farm laborers and construction workers, but also people who sort packages in ware- houses, clean airplane cabins and cook in commercial kitchens. The measure would be the first major federal government regula- tion to protect Americans from heat on the job. And it is expected to meet stiff resistance from some business and industry groups, which oppose regulations that would, in some cases, require more breaks and access to water, shade and air-conditioning. \nCELAYA, Mexico — Gisela Gaytán had just arrived at an event on the first day of her may- oral campaign in central Mexico’s industrial heartland when the gunfire broke out. \nMoments later, her lifeless body laid crumpled in a pool of blood. \nThe assassination in broad day- light of Ms. Gaytán, a 37-year-old lawyer, reflects a gruesome trend in this year’s general election in Mexico. She figures among the 36 people killed since last summer while seeking public office, ac- cording to a New York Times anal- ysis, making this one of the most blood-soaked election cycles in re- cent memory. \nGraduation, and an Obligation At West Point on Saturday, President Biden told graduating cadets that “nothing is guaranteed” about America’s democracy. Page 22. \nThe candidate killings point to a threat at the core of Mexico’s de- mocracy. Voters are preparing to cast ballots next month in a spir- ited election that could produce the country’s first female presi- dent, a milestone in the world’s largest Spanish-speaking country. But analysts and law enforce- ment officials say that embold- ened cartels are spreading fear in races at the local level as they ex- pand their reach into extortion rackets, migrant trafficking and food production. \nBut even if the rule takes effect, experts say, the government’s emergency response system is poorly suited to meet the urgency of the moment. \n# \nLast year was the hottest in re- corded history, and researchers are expecting another record- breaking summer, with tempera- tures  already  rising  sharply across the Sun Belt. The heat in- dex in Miami reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit last weekend, shatter- ing daily records by 11 degrees. The surge in deaths from heat is now the greatest threat to human health posed by climate change, said Dr. John M. Balbus, the depu- ty assistant secretary for climate change and health equity in the Health and Human Services De- partment. \nofficer for the Israeli prison serv- ice, Dr. Bitton had spent hundreds of hours talking with and analyz- ing Mr. Sinwar, who in the seven months since Oct. 7 has eluded Is- rael’s forces even as their assault on Gaza has killed tens of thou- sands and turned much of the en- clave to rubble. Now American of- ficials believe Mr. Sinwar is calling the shots for Hamas in negotia- tions over a deal for a cease-fire and the release of some of the hos- tages. \nYahya Sinwar, left, and Yuval Bitton over a dozen years ago when Mr. Sinwar, now Hamas’s Gaza leader, was in an Israeli prison. \n# \nTEL AVIV — This is how Dr. Yu- val Bitton remembers the morn- ing of Oct. 7. Being jolted awake just after sunrise by the insistent ringing of his phone. The frantic voice of his daughter, who was traveling abroad, asking, “Dad, what’s happened in Israel? Turn on the TV.” \nHeightening the sense of terror, not only candidates but their fam- ily members are being increas- ingly targeted, with at least 14 such relatives killed in recent months. Some cases have been es- pecially gruesome; in Guerrero state, the dismembered bodies of a candidate for City Council and his wife were found this month. Armed groups are also turning some of the killings into mass shootings. In Chiapas state, gun- men this month killed a mayoral candidate and seven other people including the candidate’s sister and a young girl. \nNews anchors were still piecing together the reports: Palestinian gunmen  penetrating  Israel’s vaunted  defenses,  infiltrating more than 20 towns and military bases, killing approximately 1,200 people and dragging more than 240 men, women and children into Gaza as hostages. \nDr. Bitton saw that, in a sense, everything that had passed be- tween himself and Mr. Sinwar was a premonition of the events now coming to pass. He understood the way Mr. Sinwar’s mind worked as well as or better than any Israeli official. He knew from experience that the price the Ha- mas leader would demand for the hostages might well be one Israel would be unwilling to pay. And by day’s end, he knew something else: Mr. Sinwar’s op- eratives had his nephew. \n“The threat to people from ex- treme heat is reaching a point where we have to rethink how, at all levels of government, we are preparing and putting in place a response that matches the sever- ity of the problem,” Dr. Balbus said in an interview. “This is new terri- tory.” \nEven in that first moment, Dr. Bitton says, he knew with cer- tainty who had masterminded the attack: Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and Inmate No. 7333335 in the Israeli prison sys- tem from 1989 until his release in a prisoner swap in 2011. But that was not all. Dr. Bitton \nperately ill Mr. Sinwar, and how af- terward the Hamas leader had told him that “he owed me his life.” The two men had then formed a relationship of sorts, sworn ene- mies who nevertheless showed a wary mutual respect.

So when Stevie O’Hanlon, an envi- ronmentalist and organizer from Chester County, Pa., spotted him recently, she took the opportunity to question her home-state sena- tor about a pipeline in her commu- nity. \nOne day in 1855, a man walked into a newspaper office in Sydney, Australia, with an odd request. The man, later described as a “man of color” with “bright, intel- ligent eyes” and an American ac- cent, was looking for a copy of the \nthe local pipeline, which he had previously opposed, Mr. Fetter- man pulled faces of faux concern until he stepped onto an elevator and let the closing door end the in- teraction. \nThe second half was a long, blis- tering condemnation of the coun- try he had left behind, in particu- lar its revered founding docu- ment. \n“That devil in sheepskin called the Constitution of the United States,” the man wrote, is “the great chain that binds the north and south together, a union to rob and plunder the sons of Africa, a union cemented with human blood, and blackened with the guilt of 68 years.” \nMs. O’Hanlon, a co-founder of the progressive Sunrise Move- ment, was stunned. \nUnited States Constitution. The text was procured, along with a recent book on the history of the United States. Two weeks later, the man returned with a nearly 20,000-word text of his own, bearing a blunt title: “The United States Governed by Six Hundred Thousand Despots.” The first half offered an account of the author’s birth into slavery in North Carolina around 1815, his escape from his master, his years on a whaling ship and then his de- parture from “the land of the free” for the shores of Australia, where he went to work in the gold fields. \n“I’ve talked to Republicans who are much friendlier than that,” she said in an interview, after a clip of the interaction circulated widely on social media. “The person that we voted for is not the person who mocks constituents when they bring up concerns.” \nMr. Fetterman’s reaction was surprisingly hostile. Raising his phone to capture the confronta- tion on video, the senator began ridiculing her. \nThe newspaper published the narrative anonymously, in two in- stallments, attributing it only to “A Fugitive Slave.” How it was re- ceived is unknown. \nMs. O’Hanlon is not the only one wondering who Mr. Fetterman has become.
