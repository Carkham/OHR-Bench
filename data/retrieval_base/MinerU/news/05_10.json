Trump told a group of oil execu- tives and lobbyists gathered at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month that they should do- nate \\$1 billion to his presidential campaign because, if elected, he would roll back environmental rules that he said hampered their industry, according to two people who were there. \nThis article is by  Adam Rasgon , Julian E.

Attendees included execu- tives from ExxonMobil, EQT Cor- poration and the American Petro- leum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry. \nDefiant and at times disdainful of the Biden administration’s stance, their comments made clear the widening rift between Is- rael and the United States over the war and the prospect of a full- scale invasion of Rafah, where about a million Palestinians are sheltering. \nThe event was organized by the oil billionaire Harold Hamm, who has for years helped to shape Re- publican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post. \nAnd they came as high-level ne- gotiations aimed at reaching a cease-fire and hostage deal were derailed — at least for the moment — amid anger by some of the par- ticipants over a military incursion into Rafah by Israeli forces earlier this week. \nMr. Trump has publicly railed for months against President Bi- den’s energy and environmental agenda, as Mr. Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Mr. Trump had weakened or erased while in office. In particu- lar, Mr. Trump has promised to eliminate Mr. Biden’s new climate rules intended to accelerate the nation’s transition to electric vehi- cles, and to push a “drill, baby, drill” agenda aimed at opening up more public lands to oil and gas exploration. \n# \n# \nA majority of dairy farmwork- ers are Spanish-speaking immi- grants, often undocumented, who may not have paid sick leave or be protected by occupational safety laws. They may lack access to medical providers, and their em- ployers can be intolerant of ab- sences. \nAfter that incursion, Mr. Biden said the United States, Israel’s closest ally, would not ship more weapons that could be fired into crowded sections of Rafah. On Thursday, an Israeli military spokesman said his nation had enough munitions on hand to pro- ceed with its plans. \n# \nThis article is by  Apoorva Man- davilli ,  Linda Qiu  and  Emily Anthes . Even as it has become increas- ingly clear that the bird flu out- break on the nation’s dairy farms began months earlier — and is probably much more widespread — than previously thought, fed- eral authorities have emphasized that the virus poses little risk to humans. \nThis article is by  Vivian Yee , Emma Bubola  and  Liam Stack . \nCAIRO — When Israel ordered Al Jazeera on Sunday to shut down operations there, the net- work had a reporter covering a government meeting in West Je- rusalem, another in an East Jeru- salem hotel room, a third in north- ern Israel to cover clashes on the border with Lebanon and a fourth in Tel Aviv. \nposes broader public health risks. If the virus were to find its way into the wider population, experts say, dairy workers would be a likely route. \n“This sector of workers is not only at the very, very highest risk because they’re having that di- rect, intimate contact with dis- charge, raw milk, with infected animals, but they’re also at the very, very highest level of risk in terms of having no social safety net,” said Elizabeth Strater, an or- ganizer with United Farm Work- ers. \nOther Israeli leaders said the military would press ahead with its campaign to destroy Hamas, which led the Oct. 7 attacks on Is- rael. \nMr. Biden has called climate change an existential threat and has moved to cut the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and supercharging storms, heat  Continued on Page A14 \nYet there is a group of people who are at high risk for infection: the estimated 100,000 men and women who work on those farms. There has been no widespread testing to see how many may be infected. None have been vacci- nated against bird flu. That leaves the workers and their families vulnerable to a poorly tracked pathogen. And it \n“We have no idea if this virus is going to evolve to become a pan- demic strain, but we know today that farmworkers are being ex- posed, and we have good reasons to think that they are getting sick,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University  School  of  Public Health. \n“I turn to Israel’s enemies, as well as to our best of friends, and say: The state of Israel cannot be subdued,” Israel’s defense min- ister, Yoav Gallant, said at a me- morial ceremony. He said the country would do “whatever is necessary” to defend its citizens and “to stand up to those who at- tempt to destroy us.” \nBut the cameras stopped rolling when Walid al-Omari, the net- work’s bureau chief in Ramallah, in the West Bank, ordered all of them to go home. Israeli authori- ties descended on a room used by Al Jazeera in the Ambassador Ho- tel in East Jerusalem, confiscating broadcast equipment.

Humans evolved to be social creatures probably because, for our ancient ancestors, being alone could be dangerous and reduce the odds of survival. Experts think loneliness may have emerged as a unique type of stress signal to prompt us to seek companionship. With chronic loneliness, that stress response gets stuck and be- comes disadvantageous — similar to the way in which anxiety can shift a helpful fear response to a maladaptive mental illness. “Small, transient episodes of \n# \nSome people, though, experi- ence loneliness not just tran- siently but chronically. It becomes “a personality trait, something that’s pretty sticky,” said Dr. Ellen Lee, an associate professor of psy- chiatry at the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego. These individu- als seem to have “this persistent emotion that then shapes their be- havior.” \nThat’s now changing. Since 2020, California has installed more giant batteries than any- where in the world apart from China. They can soak up excess solar power during the day and store it for use when it gets dark. Those batteries play a pivotal role in California’s electric grid, partially replacing fossil fuels in the evening. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on April 30, for example, batteries supplied more than one- fifth of California’s electricity and, \nenergy’s biggest weakness: the fact that the wind and sun aren’t always available. \n# \n# \n“What’s happening in Califor- nia is a glimpse of what could hap- pen to other grids in the future,” said Helen Kou, head of U.S. power  analysis  at  Bloom- bergNEF, a research firm. “Bat- teries are quickly moving from these niche applications to shift- ing large amounts of renewable  Continued on Page A13 \nCalifornia draws more electrici- ty from the sun than any other state. It also has a timing prob- lem: Solar power is plentiful dur- ing the day but disappears by evening, just as people get home from work and electricity demand spikes. To fill the gap, power com- panies typically burn more fossil fuels like natural gas. \nfor a few minutes, pumped out 7,046 megawatts of electricity, akin to the output from seven large nuclear reactors.
