Then he stopped exercising at the gym because of patrols in his neighborhood. Now, he spends most of his days holed up in his apartment, often using his binoculars to watch officers serving draft notices to commut- ers leaving a nearby subway sta- tion. \nThis article is by  Lisa Lerer ,  Shane Goldmacher ,  Jonathan Swan  and Maggie Haberman . \nThe debate between President Biden and former President Don- ald J. Trump this week will be the highest-stakes moment of their rematch, plunging two presidents into an extraordinarily early con- frontation before a divided and an- gry nation. \n“They’re everywhere now,” said Vladyslav, 45, who, like other Ukrainians in hiding interviewed for this article, requested that his last name not be published. “I’ll try to avoid getting caught,” he said, “but I’m not sure it’s possi- ble.” \nFor Mr. Biden, the debate in At- lanta offers an opportunity to re- mind voters of the chaos of his predecessor’s  leadership,  his criminal convictions and to warn of an even darker future should he win a second term. For Mr. Trump, it’s a chance to make his case that America has grown more expen- sive, weaker and more dangerous under his successor. \nAs Russian forces are on the at- tack across the front line, the Ukrainian military has been des- perately trying to replenish its war-battered forces, embarking on a large-scale mobilization cam- paign backed by new laws. While many Ukrainian men have answered the call to serve, some others have tried to evade conscription. Even before the lat- est mobilization push, thousands of men had fled the country to avoid service, some of them swim- ming across a river separating Ukraine from Romania. Now, as officers scour the country’s cities to draft men of military age, cur- rently 25 to 60, many people like Vladyslav have gone into hiding, fearful that conscription is a one- way ticket to the front line. It is not clear how many men are hiding out, but in big cities like Kyiv and Lviv, social media groups alerting members to the movements of draft officers in- clude tens of thousands of mem- \nHow pharmacy benefit managers inflate the cost \nof prescription drugs for millions of people. \nBut the face-off on Thursday also poses significant risks for the two men — both of them the oldest candidates ever to compete in a presidential race — who have been locked in a contentious ri- valry defined by mutual hatred for more than four years. That ani- mosity heightens the evening’s unpredictability. A notable mis- step — a physical stumble, a men- tal lapse or a barrage of too-per- sonal insults — could reverberate for months, because of the unusu- ally long period until their second debate in September. \nJENS MORTENSEN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES \ndo,” Jon Mahrt, president of United- Health’s P .B.M., Optum Rx, said in an in- terview. The main lobbying group for the P .B.M.s says that in 2022 they saved their clients and patients \\$286 billion. \n200 million Americans. They are owned by huge health care conglomerates — CVS Health, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group — and are hired by employers and govern- ments. \n# \n# \nAmericans are paying too much for pre- scription drugs. \nIt is a common, longstanding complaint. And the culprits seem obvious: Drug com- panies. Insurers. A dysfunctional federal government. \nThe job of the P .B.M.s is to reduce drug costs. Instead, they frequently do the op- posite. They steer patients toward pricier drugs, charge steep markups on what would otherwise be inexpensive medi- cines and extract billions of dollars in hid- den fees, a New York Times investigation found. \nBut those savings appear to be largely a mirage, a product of a system where prices have been artificially inflated so that major P .B.M.s and drug companies can boost their profits while taking credit for reducing prices. \nBut there is another collection of power- \n# \nThe Times interviewed more than 300 current and former P .B.M. employees, pa- tients, physicians, pharmacists and other industry experts, and reviewed court doc- uments and patient records. The investi- gation found that the largest P .B.M.s often act in their own financial interests, at the expense of their clients and patients. Among the findings: \n“This is a big inflection point,” said Karl Rove, a leading Republi- can strategist who guided George W.

They are called pharmacy benefit man- agers. And they are driving up drug costs for millions of people, employers and the government. \n\n# \n■ P .B.M.s sometimes push patients to- ward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs, shunning cheaper alternatives. \nThe P .B.M. negotiates with drug compa- nies, pays pharmacies and helps decide which drugs patients can get at what price.

For a few hours this month, one flag also honored Representative Ritchie Torres, the first openly gay Afro- Latino member of Congress. But Mr. Torres is also an outspo- ken supporter of Israel, and not long after his flag went up, it was torn down by the gay activist group ACT-UP , which was also honored at the park, and replaced with two flags, one of which hon- ored queer Palestinians. \nat home in their own country. That feeling, a vague but po- tent malaise, has many elements. They include a sense of dispos- session, of neighborhoods trans- formed in dress and habits by the arrival of mainly Muslim immigrants from North Africa, and of lost identity in a fast- changing world. The National Rally, whose anti-immigrant position lies at the core of its fast-growing popularity, has benefited from all this. “No French citizen would tolerate living in a house without \nMs. Chang-Kim also exchanged texts during the event with Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia Col- lege, according to The Free Bea- con.
