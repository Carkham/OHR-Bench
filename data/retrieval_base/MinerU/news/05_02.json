Central bankers reiter- ated that they needed “greater confidence” that inflation was coming down before reducing them. \nJERUSALEM — Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered twin messages to Hamas and Is- rael on Wednesday, pressing Ha- mas to accept a cease-fire pro- posal while at the same time urg- ing Israeli leaders to put off a ma- jor ground invasion into the thickly populated southern Gaza city of Rafah. \n“Readings on inflation have come in above expectations,” Je- rome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference after the re- lease of the central bank’s rate de- cision. \nOn the last day of a Middle East trip, his seventh visit to the region since the war began in October, Mr. Blinken tried to turn up the pressure on Hamas. \nThe Fed stands at a complicated economic juncture. After months of rapid cooling, inflation has proved surprisingly sticky in early 2024.

That calls into question how soon and how much officials will be able to re- duce interest rates. \n“We are determined to get a cease-fire that brings the hos- tages home and to get it now, and the only reason that that wouldn’t be achieved is because of Hamas,” Mr. Blinken said at the start of a meeting in Tel Aviv with Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel. “There is a proposal on the table, and as we’ve said: No delays, no excuses.

A bill to repeal the law passed, 16-14, in the Republican-controlled State Senate with the support of every Democratic senator and two Republicans who broke with anti-abortion conservatives who \nrights ballot measure before Ari- zona voters in November. On the right, it created a rift between anti-abortion activists who want to keep the law in place and Re- publican politicians who worry about the political backlash that could be prompted by support of a near-total abortion ban with no \nthat he expected more from Israel. Speaking  to  reporters  on Wednesday night after a day of meetings with Israeli leaders, in- cluding nearly three hours with Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- yahu, Mr. Blinken said that the Is- raelis had not convinced him that they can prevent the humanitar- ian catastrophe that is feared should there be a ground invasion of Rafah. \n\n# \n“We cannot, will not, support a major military operation in Rafah absent an effective plan to make sure that civilians are not harmed — and no, we’ve not seen such a plan,” Mr. Blinken told reporters. “There are other ways, and in our judgment better ways, of dealing with the real, ongoing challenge of Hamas that does not involve, re- quire, a major military operation.” Mr. Blinken’s visit to the Middle East, which began on Monday, came as Israel is both softening some of its demands in negotia- tions over a cease-fire and digging in on its vow to move into Rafah “with or without a deal,” as Mr. Ne- tanyahu put it earlier this week. In its latest proposal, Israel said it would ease travel back to north- ern Gaza for Palestinian civilians uprooted by its assault, according to two Israeli officials. That is a sharp reversal on an issue that has been a sticking point in the talks. \n# \nPaul Auster, the prolific nov- elist, memoirist and screenwriter who rose to fame in the 1980s with his postmodern reanimation of the noir novel and who endured to become one of the signature New York writers of his generation, died on Tuesday evening at his home in Brooklyn. He was 77. \nplement of Britain once called him “one of America’s most spectacu- larly inventive writers.” \nThough a New Jersey native, he became indelibly linked with the rhythms of his adopted city, which was a character of sorts in much of his work — particularly Brooklyn, where he settled in 1980 amid the oak-lined streets of brownstones in the Park Slope neighborhood. As his reputation grew, Mr. Auster came to be seen as a guard- ian of Brooklyn’s rich literary past, as well as an inspiration to a new generation of novelists who flocked to the borough in the 1990s and later. \nWith his hooded eyes, soulful air and leading-man looks, Mr. Auster was often described as a “literary superstar” in news ac- counts.

As teen- agers, my friends and I read Auster’s work avidly for both its strangeness — that touch of Euro- pean surrealism — and its close- ness. \n\nThe university canceled classes on Wednesday after violent clashes over the war in Gaza.
