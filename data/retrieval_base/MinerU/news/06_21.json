Cannon drew the assignment in June 2023 to oversee former Pres- ident Donald J. Trump’s classified documents case, two more experi- enced colleagues on the federal bench in Florida urged her to pass it up and hand it off to another ju- rist, according to two people briefed on the conversations. The judges who approached Judge Cannon — including the chief judge in the Southern Dis- trict of Florida, Cecilia M. Alton- aga — each asked her to consider whether it would be better if she were to decline the high-profile case, allowing it to go to another judge, the two people said. But Judge Cannon, who was ap- pointed by Mr. Trump, wanted to keep the case and refused the judges’ entreaties. Her assign- ment drew attention because she has scant trial experience and had previously shown unusual favor to Mr. Trump by intervening in a way that helped him in the crimi- nal investigation that led to his in- dictment, only to be reversed in a sharply critical rebuke by a con- servative appeals court panel. The extraordinary and previ- ously undisclosed effort by Judge Cannon’s colleagues to persuade her to step aside adds another di- mension to the increasing criti- cism of how she has gone on to handle the case. She has broken, according to \n# \nJERUSALEM — Growing divi- sions between Israel’s military commanders and the civilian gov- ernment over the war in Gaza spilled into the open this week, raising questions about how Is- rael will conduct the next phase of the war. \nThe rift has grown quietly for months, as Prime Minister Ben- jamin Netanyahu and his allies have at times appeared to blame the Israeli security services for the failure to prevent the Hamas- led surprise attack on Oct. 7. More recently, the military has been frustrated by the Netanyahu gov- ernment’s fight to maintain the exemption from service enjoyed by ultra-Orthodox Jews while Is- raeli forces are stretched thin. \nBut the sharpest and most pub- lic break came on Wednesday, with unusually blunt comments from the armed forces’ chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, reflecting fears among military leaders that the govern- ment’s failure to articulate a vi- sion for a postwar Gaza could squander the gains made against Hamas. “If we do not bring some- thing else to Gaza, at the end of the day, we will get Hamas,” he said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 13. \n# \n# \ntal and survived, but Dr. Ghayyda, 52, who left Gaza in 2003, said the episode convinced him he had to evacuate his family at any cost. “I thought I’d go to sleep one night and wake up to the news that my family is gone,” he said. “I felt helpless and hopeless, but I knew I had to do something.” Over the past eight months, an estimated 100,000 people have left Gaza, Diab al-Louh, the Palestin- ian ambassador to Egypt, said in an interview. Though some man- aged to get out through connec- tions to foreign organizations or governments, for many Gazans, exiting the territory is possible  \n# \n# \nJERUSALEM — The only way for almost all people in Gaza to es- cape the horrors of the war be- tween Israel and Hamas is by leaving  through  neighboring Egypt. And that is usually a compli- cated and expensive ordeal, in- volving the payment of thousands of dollars to an Egyptian company that can get Palestinians on an ap- proved travel list to cross the bor- der. Confronting the company’s stiff \n# \nlawyers who operate there, with a  Continued on Page A17 \nIn 2021, Chris Gloninger, a tele- vision weatherman in Boston with a passion for climate science, was approached with an intriguing prospect. Would he consider a job as chief meteorologist at a televi- sion station in Des Moines? It was a smaller market, and talk of global warming would be challenging in a politically conser- vative state. But research from 2020 showed that most Iowans were interested in news about cli- mate change, and the state was a leader  in  wind  energy.  Mr. Gloninger’s  weather  forecasts could be a breakthrough. An interview with the station’s news director, Allison Smith, clinched it. The station, KCCI, wanted to amp up climate cover- age, Mr. Gloninger said he was told, not least because agriculture was so important in the state. In announcing Mr. Gloninger’s hiring to the newsroom, Ms. Smith highlighted his extensive climate coverage. Another meteorologist who was considered for the same job, Matt Serwe, said that in his in- terview with KCCI, coverage of global warming was underscored. “My big takeaway was that there’s going to be a lot of climate in- volved,” said Mr. Serwe, now a me- teorologist at KSTP in St. Paul, Minn. \ncampaign,  many  Palestinians have resorted to trying to raise money with desperate appeals on digital platforms like GoFundMe. Dr. Salim Ghayyda, a pediat- rician  in  northern  Scotland, posted one such plea in January after his sister texted from Gaza to say that their father had suf- fered seizures. Their father made it to a hospi- \n“Who is that someone else, what is that thing?” he asked. “The political leadership will de- cide. But in order to reach a situa- tion in which we really weaken Hamas, that is the path.” \nDONALD SUTHERLAND,  1935-2024 \nAdmiral Hagari also appeared to criticize Mr. Netanyahu’s oft-re- peated call for “absolute victory” over the Palestinian armed group. “The idea that it is possible to de- stroy Hamas, to make Hamas van- ish — that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,” he said. \nfees, as well as the widespread hunger in Gaza where there is no end in sight to Israel’s military \n\nThat prompted a swift rejoinder from Mr. Netanyahu’s office, which said that the Israeli cabinet had set “the destruction of Ha- mas’s military and governing ca- pabilities” as one of the war’s aims and that the Israeli military was “of course committed to this.” \nHis career lasted six decades. \nMr. Netanyahu, no stranger to political conflict, is embattled on multiple fronts, feuding publicly with members of his own party, with leaders of other parties in his governing coalition, and with the Biden administration. But the public rift with military leaders is particularly  striking  amid wartime pressure for unity. \n# \n# \n“There’s an enormous lack of trust. The military no longer be- lieves in the political leadership, parts of which no longer believe in the army,” said Gadi Shamni, a re- tired Israeli general. “The mili- tary sees a lack of overall strategy, \n# \nDonald Sutherland, whose abil- ity to both charm and unsettle, both reassure and repulse, was amply displayed in scores of film roles as diverse as a laid-back bat- tlefield surgeon in “M\\*A\\*S\\*H,” a ruthless Nazi spy in “Eye of the Needle,” a soulful father in “Ordi- nary People” and a strutting fas- cist in “1900,” died on Thursday in Miami. He was 88. \nIn the spring of 2021, Mr. Gloninger and his wife sold their house in Boston and relocated to a graceful ranch house on the out- skirts of Des Moines. \nFor some in Iowa, news that KCCI had hired a chief meteorolo- gist to talk about climate science seemed heaven sent. Channing Dutton, a longtime climate activ- ist and personal injury lawyer in Des  Moines,  likened  Mr. Gloninger’s arrival to “a thunder- clap among the climate communi- ty.” \nTIGHTENED GRIP  A quiet change increases an Israeli official’s sway on the West Bank.
