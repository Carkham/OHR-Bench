Digs In to Try to Stop Winning Streak Since End of Roe \nCINCINNATI — From his new home in Cincinnati, JD Vance would go to St. Gertrude to meet the friar. \nIt was a fitting place for the mil- lennial aspiring politician, who was drawn to the Roman Catholic Church’s ancient ways. For years he had flirted with joining the church. Now he wanted to explore the desire in earnest. \n# \nBallot measures on abortion rights have succeeded beyond what even their proponents imag- ined when the United States Su- preme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. \nSt. Gertrude Church was led by the Dominican Friars from the Province of St. Joseph, part of a re- ligious order founded in 1216. Its sanctuary smelled of incense but felt modern, its concrete walls pierced with bright stained-glass rectangles in reds and blues. \nThey have not only enshrined a constitutional right to abortion and restored access to the pro- cedure in red and purple states. They have also converted what had been a voter mobilization ad- vantage for Republicans into one for Democrats. \nther Henry Stephan. For months, they read works of theology, mys- ticism, and political and moral phi- losophy. Sometimes they went to coffee or lunch. It was bespoke private instruction, a hallmark of Dominicans who are known for their lives of intellect and study. Then, one summer day in 2019, Mr. Vance, then 35, returned to St. Gertrude, this time to be baptized and receive his first communion in the Dominicans’ private chapel. The friars hosted a celebratory re- ception for his family with dough- nuts. He chose as his patron Saint Augustine, the political theologian whose fifth-century treatise “City of God ”  challenged Rome’s ruling class and drew Mr. Vance to the faith. \nNow the strategy — and an un- broken winning streak — faces its biggest test ever, with 10 states asking voters whether to estab- lish a right to abortion in their con- stitutions. On Friday, Nebraska became the final state to certify — it will be the only state with two measures, one sponsored by abor- tion rights supporters and the other by opponents. \n# \nA bus is a mobile history museum in Cambodia, teaching students in the countryside about the horrors of the Khmer Rouge.

The hunt went on, with a dearth of hard evidence on his whereabouts. \nIt is a playbook used by Hamas leaders in the past, and by other terrorist leaders like Osama bin Laden. And yet Mr. Sinwar’s situa- tion is more complex, and even more frustrating to American and Israeli officials. \n# \n# \n# \nWASHINGTON — In January, Israeli and American officials thought they had caught a break in the hunt for one of the world’s most wanted men. \nSince the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel that he planned and di- rected, Mr. Sinwar has been some- thing of a ghost: never appearing in public, rarely releasing mes- sages for his followers and giving few clues about where he might be. \nmas in a conflict that has decimat- ed the group’s ranks but also de- stroyed the Gaza Strip and killed tens of thousands of civilians. U.S. and Israeli officials said Mr. Sinwar  abandoned  electronic communications long ago, and he has avoided a sophisticated intel- ligence dragnet. He is believed to stay in touch with the organiza- tion he leads through a network of human couriers. How that system works remains a mystery. \nUnlike bin Laden in his last years, Mr. Sinwar is actively man- aging a military campaign. Diplo- mats involved in cease-fire negoti- ations in Doha, Qatar, say that Ha- mas representatives insist they need Mr. Sinwar’s input before they make major decisions. As the most respected Hamas leader, he is the only person who can ensure that whatever is decided in Doha is implemented in Gaza. \n“It was the best criticism of our modern age I’d ever read,” Mr. Vance later explained in a Catho- lic literary journal. “A society ori- ented entirely towards consump- tion and pleasure, spurning duty and virtue.” \nIsraeli commandos raided an elaborate tunnel complex in the southern Gaza Strip on Jan. 31 based on intelligence that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, was hiding there, according to Ameri- can and Israeli officials. \nAnd while voters have sided with abortion rights in all seven states where the question has ap- peared on the ballot since Roe’s re- versal, this year’s map poses far steeper challenges, with citizen- sponsored abortion rights meas- ures in five red states, two with near-total bans and all with ag- gressive opposition from Republi- can governors, courts or legisla- tures. \nHe is by far Hamas’s most im- portant figure, and his success in evading capture or death has de- nied Israel the ability to make a foundational claim: that it has won the war and eradicated Ha- \nMuch has been made of Mr. Vance’s very public conversion to Trumpism, and his seemingly mu- table political stances. But his qui- eter, private conversion to Cathol- icism, occurring over a similar stretch of years, reveals some core values at the heart of his per- sonal and political philosophy and their potential impact on the coun- try. \nHe had been, it turned out.

She reported to the group’s founder, a charismatic activist with a compelling life story: His fi- ancé had been killed by an abu- sive cop. She believed their non- profit would show the world it did not need law enforcement. \nBefore the hour was up on Mon- day, he added that Vanderbilt would not tolerate threats, har- assment or protests “disrupting the learning environment.” \nThis month, Vanderbilt re- quired all first-year undergradu- ate students to attend mandatory meetings about the university’s approach to free speech, with the hope that clear expectations — and explanations for them — would help administrators keep order after protests rocked Amer- ican campuses toward the end of the last academic year. \n# \nThen her boss went on vacation, and left her, as deputy director, in charge.
