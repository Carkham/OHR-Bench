Trump keeps adding new tax cuts to his list of campaign promises, and their pro- jected costs keep piling up. \nCommunity grief, long-simmer- ing fury and distrust of govern- ment gave way to waves of pro- tests that continued for months. There were violent confrontations between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers. A  neighborhood  convenience store was looted and burned to the ground. The protests drew activ- ists from across the nation, ampli- fied the national Black Lives Mat- ter movement and fueled larger questions about race in America. \nIndependent analyses suggest Mr. Trump’s plans could add close to \\$4 trillion over the next decade to America’s already fast-growing national debt, even after factoring in additional revenues from new taxes he wants to impose on im- ports. \nIt is impossible to make a simi- larly precise estimate for Vice President Kamala Harris, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent this fall. She has not laid out any tax or spending plans, or other economic policy proposals, with enough detail to estimate whether they would add to deficits or re- duce them. \nit created a political incubator of emerging local leaders: A new generation of young protesters who came of age during the Fer- guson uprising have found ways to chip away at the racial dispari- ties in Ferguson and nearby St. Louis, shifting from protests to politics and policies. \n# \nNew York City is facing a collision of its biggest challenges, an influx of migrants and the enduring issue of homelessness. Page A9. \n# \n\nBut late Friday afternoon, Har- ris campaign officials said they would point to President Biden’s most recent budget proposal as an indicator of Ms. Harris’s future fis- cal policy plans. That budget, re- leased in March, calls for about \\$3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, largely by raising taxes on corporations and high earners. \nSince Mr. Brown’s death, Fergu- son elected its first Black mayor. The police chief and more than half of the police officers are Black. And St. Louis County elected its first Black prosecutor. \n# \nbekistan was getting her long blond hair braided and a BMX racer from Colombia was having her nails painted in the colors of her national flag. Some days there are up to 10 hairdressers arrayed in the space, all of them from top salons around France and equipped to help rep- licate an authentic beauty parlor and barbershop. The only difference is the price: For Olympians, the haircuts are free. \nThey are one of the most popu- lar teams at the Olympics. Their hand-eye coordination is off the charts. Their uniforms? Head-to- toe black and très chic. \n“Ferguson gave birth to all kinds of young people who were committed to civil rights and so- cial justice and representation,” said Kimberly Norwood, a Wash- ington University law professor and editor of “Ferguson’s Fault Lines: The Race Quake That Rocked a Nation.” \nTotal federal debt is now about \\$35 trillion, up from about \\$20 tril- lion when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, Treasury Department data shows. It grew by about \\$7.8 tril- lion on Mr. Trump’s watch and has increased by about \\$7.3 trillion on Mr. Biden’s watch thus far. Deficit hawks in Washington warn that a further acceleration would elevate risks of an economi- cally debilitating spiral, where ris- ing debt pushes up borrowing costs in financial markets. That would then cause the debt to fur- ther balloon. \nThey are the hairstylists of the Summer Games, at the service of any Olympian in the athletes’ vil- lage in need of grooming and on a mission to substantiate that old sports mantra: look good, feel good, play good. \nMr. Brown’s death was part of a series  of  high-profile  police killings over a decade, from Eric Garner to Sonya Massey. Two years before Mr. Brown died, Trayvon Martin had been killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, drawing protests across the na- tion. Taken collectively, the vio- lence against African Americans catalyzed the national Black Lives Matter movement. \n“I’m not going out there looking scrappy,” Aphiwe Dimba, 23, a goalkeeper for South Africa’s field hockey team, said as she settled into a stylist’s chair last week. “It gives me more confidence after I get a cut. You never know who is taking your picture.” \n“It’s a moment for them to relax and forget the competition,” said Darygue Cordinier, who stepped away from Chopperhead, his bar- bershop in Paris, to work this month at the Olympics. “We’re here to take care of them.” But looking good, according to athletes, is not purely a superficial pursuit. \n“It’s a lot more troubling now, because the overall fiscal and eco- nomic environment is a lot worse” than it was before Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden took office, said Marc Goldwein, the senior vice presi- dent for the nonpartisan Commit- tee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington. The next president will already be facing what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pre- dicts will be growing deficits,  Continued on Page A13 \nIf the Olympic Village cafeteria is a space for spontaneous social interaction, its serene salon in the main plaza is a refuge of self-care: kicking back, primping and opti- mizing one’s aura before it’s time to compete.

In Mr. Walz’s telling, the victory also eventually proved to be a launch- pad for politics. Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign are touting Mr. Walz’s coaching to broaden the ticket’s appeal, a time-tested strategy that Mr. Walz himself has long used. \nThe Metrodome in Minneapolis hummed, its sidelines jammed on a fall Friday night. The Mankato West Scarlets, who had started the 1999 high school football sea- son with a miserable record of 2-4, had improbably swaggered into a state championship game. Now, less than three minutes stood be- tween them and a title. \nAfter capturing several small settlements the last few days, Ukraine was battling to take full control of a town near the border and sending small units to con- duct raids farther into the south- western Russian region of Kursk. At the same time, the Russian military announced it was send- ing more troops and armored ve- hicles to try to repel the attack. Russian television released vid- eos of columns of military trucks carrying artillery pieces, heavy machine guns and tanks. Perhaps preparing for retalia- tion, Ukrainian authorities on Fri- \nHis time as a coach serves as a glimpse into the personality he is bringing to the playing field of politics, with friendliness and warmth masking a contagious competitiveness. And Mr. Walz’s years in coaching show a ruthless willingness to change tactics as necessary. \nTheir defense, though, would first have to repel the Cambridge- Isanti Bluejackets, who were from north of Minneapolis and trailed by a single touchdown. The quar- terback hurled a desperate pass toward the end zone. But inside the 10-yard line, a Scarlet defend- er intercepted the ball, effectively clinching a 35-28 victory and Mankato West’s first champi- onship. \nAs a high school coach in Min- nesota and Nebraska, Mr. Walz was not a master tactician, inter- views with more than a dozen players and coaches suggest, nor  Continued on Page A12 \n# \nA coach lifted Tim Walz, then the defensive coordinator and now the Democratic candidate for \nIn Bedford-Stuyvesant, an animal lover thought she was doing the right thing by freeing several goldfish that were in a sidewalk pit.
