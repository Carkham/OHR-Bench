Senator Chuck Schu- mer, the New York Democrat and majority leader, said in a state- ment, “In light of this guilty ver- dict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constitu- ents, the Senate and our country, and resign.” \nThis article is by  Benjamin Weiser ,  Tracey Tully ,  Nicholas Fan- dos  and  Maria Cramer . \nSenator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a powerful Democrat who once led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was con- victed on Tuesday of participating in a vast international bribery scheme, in which prosecutors said he had accepted gold, cash and other payoffs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors abroad and at home. \nMr. Menendez had resisted calls to step down before his trial, but he could now face a rare expul- sion vote by his Senate colleagues if he does not leave voluntarily.

Mr. Me- nendez was found guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud, extor- tion, obstruction of justice, con- spiracy and acting as an agent for Egypt. \n\nThe verdict made Mr. Menen- dez the first United States senator to be found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign power and the seventh to be convicted of a fed- eral crime while in office. Mr. Menendez, 70, now faces the possibility of many years in prison when he is sentenced by the judge, Sidney H. Stein. Eight of the counts on which he was con- victed carry potential 20-year sentences.

Their passion for Mr. Trump has long transcended slogans on faded rally T-shirts or political bumper stickers, but now, it appears to be reaching new heights after the as- sassination attempt on Saturday. “Something’s got to be at play,” said Michael Thompson, the Re- publican chairman in Lee County, Fla., while looking toward the sky as if to invoke the heavens. “I don’t think the average person could withstand a tenth of what he has gone through.

Yet he has drawn a commit- ted core of followers — many in Milwaukee this week for his nomi- nating convention — who view him as handpicked by God for a second term in the White House.

Under martial law, with the country at war, no elections are possible to replace members who switched jobs, joined the army, fled the country or quit.
