Iran retaliated with its first direct attack on Israel af- ter decades of enmity, launching more than 300 drones and mis- siles toward the country, many of which were shot down.

The helicopter, carrying Mr. Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, state media re- ported, crashed near the city of Varzaghan around 1 p.m. local time, in bad weather and thick fog. Search  and  rescue  teams scoured an area of tall mountains and dense forest through rain and fog for more than 10 hours. At one point the authorities called off the aerial search because of the weather, dispatching on foot sol- diers, elite commandos of the Rev- olutionary Guards and 40 rescue teams to locate the crash site. Even well into the night, state media had not yet reported on cas- ualties, or on the condition of the president or anyone else aboard. The cause of the crash was also unknown. \nwidespread anger, with many res- idents calling for an end to clerical rule.

From City Hall to Congress, public officials increas- ingly describe threats and har- assment as a routine part of their jobs. Often masked by online ano- nymity and propelled by extreme political views, the barrage of menace has changed how public officials do their work, terrified their families and driven some from public life altogether. By almost all measures, the evi- dence of the trend is striking. Last year, more than 450 federal judges were targeted with threats, a roughly 150 percent increase from \n# \n# \nOne Friday last month, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congress- man from Maryland, spent a chunk of his day in court securing a protective order. \n“There will be no disruption in the country’s operation,” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on state TV . “Senior officials are doing their work and I have advised them on the necessary points and all of the country’s operation will carry on smoothly and orderly.” Mr. Raisi, a conservative who violently  crushed  dissent,  is widely viewed as a possible suc- cessor to the supreme leader.

And Mr. Trump, the presump- tive Republican presidential nom- inee, refused to rule out violence if he were to lose in November. “It always depends on the fairness of the election,” he said in an inter- view late last month. This was just a typical month in American public life, where a steady undercurrent of violence \nATLANTA — President Biden invoked Scripture and lessons from his own tragic past on Sun- day in a commencement address to hundreds of young Black men at Morehouse College, saying he believes there are “extremist forces aligned against the mean- ing and message” of the presti- gious institution. \nIt was not his first. Mr. Raskin, who played a leading role in Don- ald J. Trump’s second impeach- ment hearing, said he received about 50 menacing calls, emails and letters every month that are turned over to the Capitol Police. His latest court visit was prompted by a man who showed up at his house and screamed in his face about the Covid-19 vac- cine, Mr. Trump’s impeachment and  gender-related  surgeries. Nearly two years earlier, the same man, with his 3-year-old son in his arms, had yelled profanities at Mr. Raskin at a July 4 parade, accord- ing to a police report. \nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, a conservative leader. \nMr. Biden’s speech, delivered at the historically Black men’s col- lege in Atlanta, put him directly in front of hundreds who represent a slice of the electorate that is drift- ing away from him over the war in Gaza and growing apathy about their choices ahead of the election. Mr. Biden used the moment to say that manhood was not about “tough talk” and “bigotry” but about calling out hate. \n# \n\n# \n“I told the judge I don’t care about him getting jail time. He just needs some parenting lessons,” Mr. Raskin said. \nOver the course of a month- long criminal trial, the evidence against Donald J. Trump has piled up. \nbusiness records he is charged with falsifying — is Michael D. Cohen. And for prosecutors, he was always high-reward, high- risk. Though Mr. Cohen got off to a strong start, Mr. Trump’s law- yer eventually hammered his credibility, highlighting his crimi- nal record and painting him as a serial liar bent on taking down the former president. \nMr. Raskin was far from the only government official staring down the uglier side of public service in America in recent weeks. Since late March, bomb threats  closed  libraries  in Durham, N.C.; Reading, Mass.; and Lancaster, Pa., and sus- pended operations at a court- house in Franklin County, Pa. In Bakersfield, Calif., an activist pro- testing the war in Gaza was ar- rested after telling City Council members: “We’ll see you at your house. We’ll murder you.” \n“Their idea of being a man is toxic,” Mr. Biden told the gradu- ates, a reference to adversaries he did not name — but, given that his other events this weekend were focused on attacking his Republi- can competitor, Donald J.

Mr. Usyk’s victory over the British boxer Tyson Fury was a rare piece of good news for an em- battled nation that is struggling to contain Russian advances, partic- ularly in the northeast, where Moscow has opened a new front. President Volodymyr Zelensky lauded the victory as a symbol of \ndown American flag — a “Stop the Steal” symbol of protest by Don- ald J.
