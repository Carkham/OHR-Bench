In Daryino, a town five miles to the west, other soldiers also grabbed a Russian flag. “Just throw it away,” a Ukrainian soldier said, grinning, as another flexed his muscles. \nWith the Biden administration racing to get cease-fire negotia- tions back on track, a growing number of national security offi- cials across the government said that the Israeli military had se- verely set back Hamas but would never be able to completely elimi- nate the group. \nIn many respects, Israel’s mili- tary operation has done far more damage against Hamas than U.S. officials had predicted when the war began in October. \n# \n# \nOn Aug. 6, Ukraine launched an audacious  military  offensive, planned and executed in secrecy, with the aim of upending the dy- namics of a war it has appeared to be losing, town by town, as Rus- sian troops have ground forward in the east. The operation sur- prised even Kyiv’s closest allies, including the United States, and has pushed the limits of how West- ern military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Rus- sian territory. \nIsraeli forces can now move freely throughout Gaza, the offi- cials said, and Hamas is bloodied and damaged. Israel has de- stroyed or seized crucial supply routes from Egypt into Gaza. About 14,000 combatants in Gaza have been killed or captured, the Israeli military said last month. (The U.S. intelligence agencies use different, more conservative methodologies to estimate Hamas casualties, though the precise number remains classified.) The Israeli military also as- \nthem responded with the same patterns of brain activity seen in healthy people, suggesting that they were able to think and at least somewhat aware. Dr. Nicholas Schiff, a neurolo- gist at Weill Cornell Medicine and an author of the study, said the study shows that up to 100,000 pa- tients in the United States alone might have some level of con- sciousness despite their devastat- ing injuries. \nStudy Finds Many May Be Able to Think in ‘Vegetative State’ \n# \nWhen people suffer severe brain damage  $-$   as a result of car crashes, for example, or falls or aneurysms — they may slip into a coma for weeks, their eyes closed, their bodies unresponsive. Some recover, but others enter a mysterious state: eyes open, yet without clear signs of conscious- ness. Hundreds of thousands of such patients in the United States alone are found to be in a vegeta- tive state or minimally conscious. They may survive for decades without regaining a connection to the outside world. These patients pose an agoniz- ing mystery both for their families and for the medical professionals \n# \nThe pivot seems clear. The Re- publican Party of the post-Roe era is sidelining anti-abortion activ- ists. Project 2025, the conserva- tive blueprint with innovative abortion bans, has been disa- vowed by Donald J. Trump. And the new G.O.P . party platform even promises to advance access to in vitro fertilization. \nwho care for them.

Prigozhin’s march on Moscow in June 2023: the vaunted security state that President Vladimir V . Putin had built crumbled in the face of the surprise attack, failing in its basic task of protecting its citizens. And the unwritten social contract that has largely accompanied Mr. Putin’s 30-month campaign — that most Russians could get on with their normal lives even as he waged war — was cast into ques- tion anew. \nThe results should lead to more \nTeams of neurologists at six re- search centers asked 241 unre- sponsive patients to spend sev- eral minutes at a time doing com- plex cognitive tasks, such as imagining themselves playing tennis.

More than 132,000 people have been evacuated from nearby areas, Russian officials said. “Russia brought war to others,  \nThey are planting seeds for their ultimate goal of ending abor- tion from conception, both within the Republican Party and beyond it. They face a tough political bat- tle since their positions are largely unpopular and do not reflect ma- jority opinion, particularly on I.V.F . \nAs they see it, their challenge stretches across generations, not simply a single political cycle. And their approach — including con- trolling  regulatory  language, state party platforms and the defi- nition of when life begins — re- flects an incremental strategy similar to the one activists used for decades to eventually over- turn Roe v. Wade. \nOfficials say further attacks only raise the risk to civilians. \n# \n“I expect there will be steps backwards as well as what we are working toward, which are long strikes forward,” said R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the South- ern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., who has been newly mobilizing evangelicals against I.V .F. \n# \nWASHINGTON — When Jo- seph R.

In May, at the twilights of their long careers, Mr. Biden, 81, awarded Ms. Pelosi, 84, the Presi- dential Medal of Freedom, anoint- ing her the “greatest speaker of the House of Representatives in history.” \nThe fall of Roe itself was far  Mushrooms Sprout in Iowa Continued on Page A18 After decades raising hogs, the Faaborg family struggled for a way out of factory farming.

Kennedy, cultivated a natural friendship. \nThat was then. In July, Ms. Pelosi began pushing for Mr. Bi- den to exit the presidential race, and the two have not spoken since he made the difficult decision to step aside. There are multiple re- ports that Mr. Biden is angry with her. (On Wednesday, a person close to him said he was “unhap- py” with the way things went.)
