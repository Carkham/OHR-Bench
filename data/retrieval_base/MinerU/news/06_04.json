Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Mr. Bi- den’s executive order could go into effect immediately. \nMs. Sheinbaum, the first wom- an and first Jewish person to be elected president, beat her oppo- nent on Sunday by a stunning 30 percentage points or more, early returns show. She and her More- na party had been expected to win, but their resounding victory outperformed pre-election polls. “We’re taking the whole she- bang in these elections,” Mario Delgado, the head of the Morena party, said in a speech on Sun- day. \n# \n# \nThe border would reopen to asylum seekers if the number of crossings stays below 1,500 for a certain period of time, the people said. They asked for anonymity because the executive order has not been officially announced. \n# \n# \nThe Israel-Hamas war has also forced museums to confront one of the most emotional and divisive issues within the Jewish commu- nity: how to discuss the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. \nATLANTA — At a Holocaust museum in Atlanta, staff mem- bers had typically ended their tours by saying that many sur- vivors of the death camps immi- grated to Palestine. \nThe election served as a refer- endum on the nearly six-year term of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the current president, reflecting that a solid majority of the electorate has endorsed his stewardship of the country. Preliminary results show Morena taking seven of the nine governorships up for grabs — including the most prominent, Mexico City’s — and winning supermajorities in at least 22 of \n# \nThe order would be the most re- strictive border policy instituted by Mr. Biden, or any other modern Democrat, and echoes an effort in 2018 by President Donald J. Trump to curb migration that Democrats assailed and federal courts blocked. \nROME — Nationalists are surg- ing and expected to make big gains when voters from 27 nations cast ballots starting this week for the European Parliament. But the prospect of success is already raising the question among far- right parties of how far is too far. That question has become pressing as popular hard-right parties, especially in Italy and France, try to make themselves more palatable to the main- stream, splitting those who have sanitized and gained acceptability from those who are still consid- ered taboo. \n“the British Mandate of Palestine” or “the area that would become the country of Israel.” Each year, roughly two dozen Holocaust museums in the United States teach millions of visitors — often students on field trips — about the Nazi genocide of six mil- lion Jews, a history that is fading from living memory. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing war, that mission has felt especially urgent, as the number of bias incidents \nMany Holocaust museums in- clude the story of Israel’s founding in 1948, depicting the country as a refuge for Jewish survivors. But they often do not mention, or ad- dress only in guarded terms, a subject that increasingly interests some visitors: the Nakba, Pales- tinians’ term for their displace- ment amid Israel’s founding. \nAlthough the executive action is almost certain to face legal chal- lenges, Mr. Biden is under intense political pressure to address ille- gal immigration, a top concern of voters before the presidential election in November. \nSo staff members at the mu- seum, the Breman, made a few changes, according to Rabbi Jo- seph Prass, the museum’s educa- tion director.

But he also empowered the military, pri- oritized fossil fuels and pushed measures that critics say could weaken Mexico’s democratic institutions. \nContinued on Page A16 \nToday, the hard right is a move- ment marbled by fissures and shifting alliances. \n\n\nLast year, Marine Le Pen, the French nationalist, seemed to dis- parage Italy’s hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who since coming to power has tried to make herself a trustworthy part- ner for mainstream conserva- tives. \nStill, concerns over such moves did little to sway most voters from supporting Ms. Sheinbaum, who is Mr. López Obrador’s protégée, and their party. \n“Meloni is not my twin sister,” she had told the Italian newspa- per La Repubblica, making it clear she considered herself more hard line. \n“Voters gave Claudia a man- date that only a very few dared to predict,” said John Feeley, deputy chief of mission at the  Continued on Page A10 \nPresident Biden faces intense pressure on illegal migration. \nNow, Ms. Le Pen has offered to form an alliance in the European Parliament, though it is not clear if Ms. Meloni wants to allow her to ride her coattails, as Ms. Le Pen’s party is still scorned by many in the European center right. Ms. Le Pen, for her part, has dis- tanced herself from Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a far-right party that appears to have be- come too extreme even for its fel- low travelers. \n# \n# \nAlex Lawrence, a dealer in Salt Lake City who specializes in used electric cars, has seen a change over the last year in the kinds of customers who are coming into his showroom.
