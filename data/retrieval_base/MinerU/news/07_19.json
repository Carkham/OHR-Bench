The new platform softened lan- guage on abortion, excised old language referring obliquely to gay  conversion  therapy  and culled a section about reducing a national debt that Mr. Trump had increased by nearly \\$8 trillion during his term in office. But the most revealing part was not any particular provision or plank. It was the ruthless efficiency of a process months in the making that squelched, silenced or steam- rolled any forces who might op- pose Mr. Trump. The result was the latest evidence of the political maturation of Mr. Trump and his operation. \nWithin minutes of their arrival, their cellphones were confiscated and placed in magnetically sealed pouches. There would be no leaks of information. It was only then that the delegates received a copy of the platform language the Trump team had meticulously prepared, which slashed the plat- form size by nearly three-quar- ters. \nThe first years of Mr. Trump’s presidency were defined by ob- struction. He was repeatedly re- directed by advisers and rebuffed on Capitol Hill. But now, as he is about to formally accept the Re- publican Party’s nomination on Thursday in Milwaukee for the third consecutive campaign, Mr. Trump is a political veteran who has spent nearly 10 years grinding Continued on Page A17 \n“This is something that ulti- mately you’ll pass,” Mr. Trump told the delegates by phone and made audible to the room, accord- ing to a person who was there and who was not authorized to speak publicly. “You’ll pass it quickly.” He was right. Within hours, the platform committee had endorsed a document that Mr. Trump had personally dictated parts of, ac- cording to two people with direct knowledge of the events, and it all happened before the delegates got \nPOWER PLAYER  Donald Trump Jr. is a confidant to his father and a key MAGA enforcer.

One of the people close to him warned that the president had not yet made up his mind to leave the race after three weeks of insisting that almost nothing would drive him out. But another said that “re- \nMany other Democrats more distant from the White House said expectations were rising within the party that the president would soon relent, a shift from just days ago when many were in despair about changing his mind.

That is not because she is a Yale-educated lawyer with three children, or the daughter of two Indian immigrants. It’s because she does not hew to the very specific mold of femininity that has become the norm in the world of Trump. After all, there is a certain kind of look that the women in Mr. Trump’s closest orbit — his wife, daughters and daughters-in-law — all share, and that has become \nThe latest Democratic defec- tion to become public came from  Continued on Page A19 \n# \nAnd the former speaker is in no mood to start losing now, as evidence mounts that President Biden is staring at a major defeat that could drag his party down with him. \n# \nwhich in 1960 released the com- edy album “The Button-Down \n# \n# \nBob Newhart, who burst onto the comedy scene in 1960 working a stammering Everyman charac- ter not unlike himself, then rode essentially that same character through a long, busy career that included two of television’s most memorable  sitcoms,  died  on Thursday at his home in Los An- geles. He was 94. His publicist, Jerry Digney, con- firmed the death. \nIn private conversations with Mr. Biden, colleagues and allies, Ms. Pelosi, the Californian who still wields tremendous influence in her party and is seen by many as key to resolving the status of Mr. Biden’s candidacy, has let it be known in the days since his disastrous debate performance that she is skeptical that the president can win. And his loss, she fears, could cost her party its chance to win back the House, potentially its only firewall against a second Donald J. \nThe record shot to No. 1 on the charts, and at the 1961 Grammy Awards it improbably captured the top prize, album of the year. Among the nominees Mr. New- hart bested: Nat King Cole, Harry Belafonte and Frank Sinatra.
