It was too dangerous to make the five-minute drive to Al-Shifa Hospital, where Dr. Bseso, 52, worked in orthopedics. So he grabbed a kitchen knife, scissors and sewing string — then amputated Ahed’s leg on the kitchen table, where her mother had just made bread. \nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military said on Monday that it had paused operations during daylight hours in parts of the southern Gaza Strip, as a new pol- icy announced a day earlier ap- peared to take hold, along with cautious hopes that it would allow more food and other goods to reach desperate civilians. \nAid workers said they hoped that the daily pause in the Israeli offensive would make it less dan- gerous to deliver vital supplies to areas in central and southern Gaza from Kerem Shalom, a key border crossing between Israel and Gaza, removing one of many obstacles to their beleaguered op- erations. \nfind a way to save her life.” The crude surgery was cap- tured in a video shared widely on- line, a grim emblem of the agoniz- ing choices that have been re- peated countless times in a war that has ravaged Gazans’ lives and limbs. Doctors say they have been stunned by the sheer num- ber of amputations in Gaza, which put patients at risk of infection in a place where access to medical care and even clean water is lim- ited. \n# \n# \nBut aid agencies warned that other restrictions on movement, as well as lawlessness in the terri- tory, would still make it difficult to meet the dire needs of Gazans struggling to survive after eight months of war. \nLong-Lasting Methods Reach Remote Areas \n# \n# \n# \nGOASO, Ghana — On a busy day at the Kwapong Health Centre in  rural  Ghana,  Beatrice Nyamekye put contraceptive im- plants into the arms of a half-doz- en women, and gave eight or nine more a three-month hormonal in- jection to prevent pregnancy. A few sought condoms or birth con- trol pills, but most wanted some- thing longer lasting. \nIsrael’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 people in the enclave, according to Gazan health authorities. The numbers do not distinguish be- tween civilians and combatants. The war has also left an even larger number of people of wounded. Local health authorities say that number is more than 85,000 — and aid workers say that includes an outsize number of am- putees. \nWith stockpiles in southern \n# \nIn the battle to dismantle gun restrictions, raging in America’s courts even as mass shootings be- come commonplace, one name keeps turning up in the legal briefs  and  judges’  rulings: William English, Ph.D. \nAn Israeli convoy inside Gaza, where some military opera- tions paused during the day. \nAfrica, where women have the world’s lowest rate of access to contraception: Just 26 percent of women of reproductive age in the region are using a modern contra- ceptive method — something other than the rhythm or with- drawal methods — according to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, which works on reproductive and ma- ternal health. \nand in scores of lawsuits around the country to overturn limits on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and the carrying of firearms. His findings were also offered in another Supreme Court case this term, with a decision ex- pected this month. \nA little-known political econo- mist at Georgetown University, Dr. English conducted a largest- of-its-kind national survey that found gun owners frequently used their weapons for self-defense. That finding has been deployed by gun rights activists to notch legal victories with far-reaching conse- quences. \n“They like the implants and in- jections best of all,” said Ms. Nyamekye, a community health nurse. “It frees them from worry, and it is private. They don’t have to even discuss it with a husband or a partner.” \nDr. English seems at first glance to be an impartial re- searcher interested in data-driven insights. He has said his “schol- arly arc” focuses on good public policy, and his lack of apparent ties to the gun lobby has lent cred- ibility to his work. \nGaza’s health care system is ill- equipped to cope. Many of the ter- ritory’s  hospitals  have  been knocked out of service completely while others scrape by with se- vere shortages of supplies like an- esthesia and antibiotics. \nBut that is changing as more women have been able to get methods that give them a fast, af- fordable and discreet boost of re- Continued on Page A8 \nHe has been cited in a landmark Supreme Court case that invali- dated many restrictions on guns, \nThe bustle at the Kwapong clinic is echoed all over Ghana, and across much of sub-Saharan \nContinued on Page A20 \nSurgeons say the lack of sup- plies and the scale of the wounded have forced them to amputate limbs that elsewhere would have been salvageable. But it’s a lose- lose situation, they say, because amputations require close care and, frequently, further surgeries. “There’s no good options there,” said Dr. Ana Jeelani, an orthope- dic surgeon in Liverpool, England, who spent two weeks at Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza in March. “Everything requires follow-up that we do, and there is none.” Continued on Page A11 \nGaza dwindling, “maybe for a cou- ple of weeks they’ll have enough food, but if we cannot have access and sustain that, then that’s going to be a big problem,” said Carl Skau, the deputy director of the World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations that distrib- utes food in Gaza. Food supplies in southern Gaza were “more stabi- lized a month ago, but we are re- ally concerned now,” said Mr. Skau, who visited Gaza last week. The shift in Israeli operations came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disbanded the war cabinet he had formed after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, an Is- raeli official said on Monday, high- Continued on Page A11 \n\nRAFAH ATTACK  A Times investi- gation shows civilian casualties were almost inevitable.
