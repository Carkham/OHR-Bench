But despite facing a tough re- election battle where economic is- sues will be central, Mr. Biden has not leaned into that message as frequently or naturally as some other Democrats, including sena- tors running in competitive seats across the southwest and the in- dustrial Midwest. The Biden cam- paign has not focused its televi- sion or online advertisements on messages berating companies for high prices, unlike Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sher- rod Brown of Ohio, who have made the issue a centerpiece of their campaigns — and who are outrunning Mr. Biden in polls. Now, some progressives are urging Mr. Biden to follow those senators’ lead and make “greed- flation,” as they call it, a driving theme of his re-election bid.

In April, the Environmental Protec- tion Agency issued new limits on tailpipe pollution that are de- signed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032, up from 7.6 percent last year. In addition to the regulations, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, \n# \n# \nchampioned by Mr. Biden, pro- vides tax credits for buyers of new and used electric vehicles, along with incentives for charging sta- tions and grants and loans for manufacturers. \nground. A feud between two gen- erals fighting for power has dragged the country into civil war and turned the city into ground zero for one of the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophes. As many as 150,000 people have died since the conflict erupted last year, by American estimates. An- other nine million have been forced from their homes, making Sudan home to the largest dis- placement crisis on earth, the United Nations says.

Trump, particularly with the working-class voters of color Mr. Biden needs to motivate. And they believe polls show voters are primed to hear the president con- demn big corporations in more forceful terms. \nKHARTOUM, Sudan — The gold market is a graveyard of rub- ble and dog-eaten corpses. The state television station became a torture chamber. The national film archive was blown open in battle, its treasures now yellowing in the sun. \nThe push for more E.V .s comes as the world’s leading climate ex- perts say that retiring the internal combustion engine is critical to staving off the most deadly effects of global warming. \n# \nWASHINGTON — The In- fowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is seeking permission from a bankruptcy court to liquidate his personal assets and deliver the proceeds to the Sandy Hook fam- ilies who are owed more than \\$1.4 billion in damages for his lies about the 2012 school shooting. Mr. Jones also filed a separate bankruptcy for his company, Free Speech Systems, and in a hearing next Friday a judge is to rule whether the company will also be liquidated, an outcome favored by a majority of the families. That would shutter Infowars, effective the day of the ruling. It would also place assets from Infowars’ stu- dios and potentially Mr. Jones’s popular social media accounts in control of the families. \nward, starving babies fight for life.

Trump and other Republicans who frame them as the federal government taking away consumer choice. The oil and gas industry is spend- ing millions on advertising that falsely calls Mr. Biden’s policies a ban on conventional cars. Mr. Trump has made attacks on electric vehicles a mainstay of his campaign to retake the White House, falsely saying they do not work, cannot travel far and will “kill” the American automobile in- dustry. Mr. Trump has promised that if he is elected to a second term he will undo Mr. Biden’s cli- mate policies, including federal support for electric vehicles.

Its causes were complex, including snarled global supply chains, stimulative policies by the Federal Reserve and, to a degree, federal fiscal policies including Covid relief bills signed by Mr. Trump and the \\$1.9 trillion emer- gency spending measure Mr. Bi- den signed soon after taking office Continued on Page A15 \nfinitive win for the families. “For too long, Alex Jones has profited from the lies and fear that he peddles every day on Infowars, his corrupt business platform,” said Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the families who sued Mr. Jones in Connecticut. “The Connecticut families, driven by the principle that Jones must not be allowed to hurt or profit from the pain of oth- ers, are now on the brink of strip- ping him of his ability to inflict \n# \n# \nLinking History and Hope Saratoga Race Course will host the Belmont Stakes at a key moment for horse racing.

His call for American re- solve in defense of democracy came just hours after he felt com- pelled to apologize to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for the political stalemate in Washington that delayed critical American military aid for months. In a meeting in Paris before fly- ing to Normandy, Mr. Biden blamed House Republicans for the funding delay, which frustrated Ukrainians and arguably helped  Continued on Page A5 \nStacks of forgotten strips pose questions over artistic ownership. \nrediscovery by yet another new generation of shooters in the 2020s. \n# \nOn a clear and sunny afternoon overlooking Utah and Omaha beaches, the president evoked “the ghosts of Pointe du Hoc,” the Army Rangers who scaled cliffs in the face of withering German fire, to link the struggle for freedom during World War II with the fight for democracy now — both in Ukraine and in the voting booths at home. \nSilvio Cohen has been doing this for years.
