Trump used a dubious accounting maneuver to claim improper tax breaks from his troubled Chicago tower, according to an Internal Revenue Service inquiry uncov- ered by The New York Times and ProPublica. Losing a yearslong audit battle over the claim could mean a tax bill of more than \\$100 million. \ning his presidency, the I.R.S. un- dertook a high-level legal review before pursuing it. The Times and ProPublica, in consultation with tax experts, calculated that the re- vision sought by the I.R.S. would create a new tax bill of more than \\$100 million, plus interest and po- tential penalties. \nMr. Trump’s tax records have been a matter of intense specula- tion since the 2016 presidential campaign, when he defied dec- ades of precedent and refused to release his returns, citing a long- running audit. A first, partial reve- lation of the substance of the audit came in 2020, when The Times re- ported that the I.R.S. was disput- ing   $\\mathfrak{a}\\,\\mathfrak{F}{72.9}$   million tax refund that Mr. Trump had claimed starting in 2010. That refund, which ap- \nThe 92-story, glass-sheathed skyscraper along the Chicago River is the tallest and, at least for now, the last major construction project by Mr. Trump. Through a combination of cost overruns and the bad luck of opening in the teeth of the Great Recession, it was also a vast money loser. But when Mr. Trump sought to reap tax benefits from his losses, the I.R.S. has argued, he went too far and in effect wrote off the same losses twice. \n\nThe first write-off came on Mr. Trump’s tax return for 2008. With sales lagging far behind projec- tions, he claimed that his invest- ment in the condo-hotel tower met the tax code definition of “worth- less,” because his debt on the project meant he would never see a profit. That move resulted in Mr. Trump reporting losses as high as \\$651 million for the year, The Times and ProPublica found. There is no indication the I.R.S. challenged that initial claim, though that lack of scrutiny sur- prised tax experts consulted for this article. But in 2010, Mr. Trump and his tax advisers sought to ex- tract further benefits from the Chicago project, executing a ma- neuver that would draw years of inquiry from the I.R.S. First, he shifted the company that owned the tower into a new partnership. Because he controlled both com- panies, it was like moving coins from one pocket to another. Then he used the shift as justification to declare \\$168 million in additional losses over the next decade. The issues around Mr. Trump’s case were novel enough that, dur- \nSolar Storms Paint the Skies A geomagnetic event made the aurora borealis visible to many parts of the world, including Whitley Bay, England, on Friday. \n# \n# \ntens of thousands of people have been loud and disruptive and have at times taken on a sharpened edge. Jewish students have been shouted at to return to Poland, where Nazis killed three million Jews during the Holocaust. There are chants and signs in support of Hamas, whose attack on Israel sparked the current war.

The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, traveled to Columbia University two weeks ago to decry the “virus of anti- semitism” that he said pro-Pales- tinian protesters were spreading across the country. “They have chased down Jewish students. They have mocked them and re- viled them,” he said to jeers from protesters. “They have shouted racial  epithets.  They  have screamed at those who bear the Star of David.” Former President Donald J. Trump chimed in.

The White House, howev- er, kept the threat secret, making no mention of it in the official statement it released about the call. And indeed, the private warn- ing, perhaps too subtle, fell on deaf ears. \n# \nAndres Gonzalez, 19, stands on the balcony of his Los Angeles apartment, his hands in his suit pockets.

As a church leader, Dieter F . Uchtdorf, put it, missionaries should feel comfortable sharing their faith in “normal and natural ways.” \nSix days later, on Feb. 17, Mr. Bi- den heard from Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. The president’s chief diplomat was calling from his blue-and-white government plane as he was flying home from a security conference in Munich. Despite the president’s warning, Mr. Blinken reported that momen- tum for an invasion of Rafah was building. It could result in a hu- manitarian  catastrophe,  he feared. They had to draw a line. At that point, the president headed down a road that would lead to the most serious collision between the United States and Is- rael in a generation. Three months later, the president has decided to follow through on his warning, leaving the two sides in a dramatic standoff. Mr. Biden has paused a shipment of 3,500 bombs and vowed to block the delivery of other offensive arms if Israel mounts a full-scale ground inva- sion of Rafah over his objections.  \nIn the last few years, the church has also changed some rules for missionaries themselves — loos- ening restrictions on dress codes (women can wear pants) and how often they can call family mem- bers back home (once a week, not just on Christmas and Mother’s Day). \nMr. Gonzalez is the image of the modern  missionary  for  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, which has changed many of its practices — from how missionaries preach to how they dress. \nTo outsiders, the adjustments may seem small.
