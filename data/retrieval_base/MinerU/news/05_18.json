Over the three years since the program was established, New York State has bestowed more than \\$100 million on commercial Broadway productions. \nThe defeat came after Kay Ivey, Alabama’s governor, and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union’s setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama. The vote had national signifi- cance as a test of whether the U.A.W. could build on a string of recent victories and gain ground in a state whose elected officials have been hostile to organized la- bor. The union has said it wants to organize every automobile fac- tory in the United States, expand- ing its membership to include the employees of companies like Toy- ota and Tesla. \n“The Lion King,” along with other juggernauts like “Aladdin,”\n\n “The Book of Mormon” and\n\n “Wicked,” each got the maximum\n\n \\$3 million subsidy. \nThe program was initiated by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo at the height of the coronavirus pan- demic, as theaters were nervously preparing to reopen after being shut for a year and a half. It was later tripled to \\$300 million by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is consid- ering whether to seek an exten- sion when it expires next year. Some state lawmakers and fis- cal watchdogs say the theater ini- tiative, called the New York City Musical and Theatrical Produc- \nBut the loss at the Mercedes plants will almost surely slow down the union’s campaign and probably force it to do more spadework to secure the support of workers before seeking to hold elections at other auto plants. Un- ion leaders will want to spend time figuring out how best to counter the messages and tactics of local lawmakers and company executives. \nContinued on Page A22 \n# \n# \n“This loss stings,” Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at the storefront headquarters of the union’s local branch down the road from the Mercedes factories in Vance and Woodstock, Ala.

Then a pastor at the church encouraged them to kick their daughter out of their home. “This must be biblical advice,” she recalled thinking. “This must be what we’re supposed to do.” Many progressive and Mainline Christian  congregations  have moved to affirm transgender and nonbinary members. But for many conservative Christians, the rise of transgender identities in both visibility and in sheer numbers,  particularly  among young people, has been a pro- foundly destabilizing shift. Almost 90 percent of white evangelicals believe gender is determined by sex at birth, according to the Pew Research Center, compared with  Continued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nAndrew and Debbie James are evangelical Christians. Born in England, the couple moved to Denver years ago and raised their children there.

She quickly followed all kinds of accounts — from Kim Kardashian to Olive Garden, she said — and was soon spending five to six hours a day on the app. Then one day she searched for “ab work- outs,” and her feed shifted. She started seeing 200-calorie recipes, pro-anorexia posts and exercise routines that “no 12-year-old should be doing in their bedroom,” she said. \n# \n\n# \n# \nCABO DE LA VELA, Colombia — They came from all over the world to this remote stretch of Co- lombia’s Caribbean coast.

It was brought to Cabo de la Vela nearly two decades ago by visiting foreigners, or  arijuna,  a term in the Wayuu Indigenous language  that  includes  Co- lombians who aren’t Wayuu. \nMs. Lembke, now 21, testified before the Senate Judiciary Com- mittee in February 2023 about how social media led her to dis- ordered eating, and what she and other advocates see as a dire need for stronger regulation to protect social media’s youngest users.
