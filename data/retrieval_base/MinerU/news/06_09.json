Trump routinely blames Presi- dent Biden for higher prices at the grocery store and everywhere else Americans shop, and prom- ises to “fix it.” \nThis article is by  Aaron Boxer- man ,  Raja Abdulrahim  and  Steve Lohr . \nBut Mr. Trump has offered little explanation about how his plans would lower prices. And several of his policies — whatever their mer- its on other grounds — would in- stead put new upward pressure on prices, according to interviews with half a dozen economists. \nJERUSALEM — Israeli sol- diers and special operations po- lice rescued four hostages from Gaza on Saturday amid a heavy air and ground assault and flew them back to Israel by helicopter to be reunited with their families. The news was met with jubilation in Israel, where anxieties over the fate of the roughly 120 remaining captives have been rising after eight months of war. \nMr. Trump says he plans the “largest domestic deportation in American history,” which would most likely increase the cost of la- bor. He intends to impose a new tariff on nearly all imported goods, which would probably raise their prices and those of any domestic-made competitors. \nResidents in the town of Nu- seirat, where the hostages were being held, reported intense bom- bardments during the rescue op- eration. Khalil al-Daqran, an offi- cial at a hospital in the city, told re- porters that scores of Palestinians had been killed and that the hospi- tal’s wards and corridors were packed with the wounded. \nAnd he not only wants to make permanent the entire deficit-fi- nanced tax cut law he and con- gressional Republicans enacted in 2017, but also to add some kind of new “big tax cut” for individuals and businesses, which would stimulate an economy already at full employment. \nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters the rescue mission took place around 11 a.m. Saturday, when forces located the four hos- tages in two separate buildings where they were being held by Hamas militants. He said the Is- raeli forces came under fire but managed to extract the hostages in two helicopters. One special forces police officer died. \n# \n# \nAs a matter of textbook eco- nomics, each of those three signa- ture Trump policy plans would be likely to raise prices. Some could even cause continued, rather than one-time, price increases — add- ing to the possibility of inflation. \n# \n# \nGOLDFIELD, Nev. — Cindy El- gan glanced into the lobby of her office and saw a sheriff’s deputy waiting at the front counter. “Let’s start a video recording, just in case this goes sideways,” Elgan, 65, told one of her employees in the Esmeralda County clerk’s of- fice. She had come to expect skep- ticism, conspiracy theories and even threats related to her job as an election administrator. She grabbed her annotated booklet of Nevada state laws, said a prayer for patience and walked into the lobby to confront the latest chal- lenge  to  America’s  electoral process. \n1,000 military personnel from Ni- ger and shutters a \\$110 million air base there by September, U.S. offi- cials are scrambling to work with a new set of countries in coastal West Africa to battle a violent ex- tremist insurgency that they per- ceive is steadily seeping south. “Of course, it’s frustrating,” Christopher P . Maier, the Penta- gon’s top official for special opera- tions policy, said in an interview. “Our general desire to promote democratic  governments  and having healthy governance there has not gone particularly well.” The U.S. military has had more success training local counterter- rorism troops, Mr. Maier said, al- though some participated in the military takeovers. But, he added, “it’s disappointing when we’ve in- Continued on Page 12 \nTAKORADI, Ghana — In the shadow of the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States rushed troops and military aid to a swath of West Af- rica to help French forces stop the spread of Al Qaeda and other ter- rorist groups. \nRepublican Party.

All four were in good medical condi- tion and were transferred to a hos- pital in Israel for further examina- tions, the Israeli authorities said in a statement. \n“Hi, Mary Jane. What can I do for you today?” Elgan asked, as she slid a bowl of candy across the counter. \nMore than a decade later, and with hundreds of millions of dol- lars in security assistance spent, that regional counter terrorism ef- fort has largely failed. Groups that have declared alle- giance to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are on the march. Military coups have toppled civilian-led governments in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger. The new leaders have ordered American and French troops out, and in some cases invited Russian mer- cenaries in to take their place.

They’ve lost all trust in the system.” \n# \nThe fate of the hostages has been a source of intense political pressure on the Israeli prime min- ister, Benjamin Netanyahu, amid the broader criticism that his gov- ernment, for its own reasons, is in  Continued on Page 8 \n“We’re beyond that,” Zakas said.

Simpson, even in his final years, was some- what of a spectacle. \nIn his presence, heads turned and whispers swirled. There was no story about him without that white Ford Bronco, the bloody gloves, the two chilling murders. When he settled in Las Vegas seven years ago, it seemed fitting that he would choose a city of es- cape and second acts. Here, he be- came a man about town, known for pulling up to a steakhouse in a Bentley convertible, appearing at lavish parties and posing for self- ies. \n# \nWILLIAM A. ANDERS, 1933-2024 \n\n# \nMORSHYN, Ukraine — On a sunny morning, deep in the forests of western Ukraine where the war barely reaches, 16,000 cans of a new energy drink, Volia, rolled off the assembly line every hour at the Morshynska beverage factory. \nHis lifestyle was comfortable — and far too pleasant to those who believed he deserved to spend his remaining days in prison. \nStores are full of energy drinks with bombastic names. \nBut there was one element that made him feel accepted in Las Ve- gas. A little-known golf crew called In the Cup. \nSeveral hundred miles east, driving toward the front line, the sweating coolers at the minimarts and gas stations are loaded with Volia and an array of other energy drinks: Burn, Monster, Non Stop, Hell, Pit Bull and, of course, the eye-widening veteran of them all, Red Bull. \nup, I drink an energy drink. When I head out on patrol, I drink an en- ergy drink. Before an attack, I drink an energy drink,” said one Ukrainian soldier who identified himself by his call sign, Psycho, for security reasons, according to military protocol. \nIts 40 or so members are nei- ther wealthy nor powerful. They play at public courses, not lush country clubs. They are military veterans, retired police officers, small business owners, airport se- curity workers. \nBy the time one reaches the trenches, where thousands of troops are dug in, trying to sur- vive, the supremacy is complete: Ukrainian soldiers will pass up coffee, Coke, even water in favor of the liquid jolt they need to keep going. \nMost are Black. And none of them cared about Mr. Simpson’s past. \n“Let me explain something as a reconnaissance person,” Psycho continued. “When you have to walk three, four or seven kilome- ters. And you’re carrying 40 kilo- grams of gear. And you’re covered in sweat. And you haven’t eaten  \n“It’s not something we talked about, not something we dis- cussed, not something we went into. We left it alone,” said one"
