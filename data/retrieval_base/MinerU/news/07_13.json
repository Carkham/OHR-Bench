But lurking behind the Demo- crats’ anxiety is another factor: the polls. \nSANTA FE, N.M. — A judge in New Mexico dismissed the case against Alec Baldwin on Friday af- ter finding that the state had with- held evidence that could have shed light on how live rounds got onto a film set where the cinemat- ographer was fatally shot. \n# \nwith an almost THE TILT uninterrupted lead for 10 months, and this undoubt- edly shapes the calculation of Democrats in Washington. It’s hard to believe there would be any serious drive to replace Mr. Biden if the polls showed him clearly leading, as they did throughout the last election. This puts a big responsibility \nAs President Biden insists he will stay in the presidential race, Democrats are growing increas- ingly alarmed that his presence on the ticket is transforming the political map, turning light-blue states  into  contested  battle- grounds. \nThe dismissal was with preju- dice, meaning that the prosecu- tion of Mr. Baldwin is over. If he had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Baldwin would have faced up to 18 months in pris- on. \n“There is no way for the court to right this wrong,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said in court as Mr. Baldwin wept. \nDown-ballot Democrats, local elected officials and party strat- egists say Minnesota, New Hamp- shire, New Mexico and Virginia — all of which Mr. Biden won com- fortably in 2020 — could be in play in November after his miserable debate performance last month. \nIt was a stunning end to the trial of Mr. Baldwin, who was rehears- ing with a gun on the “Rust” film set in 2021 when it fired a live round, killing Halyna Hutchins, the movie’s cinematographer. Mr. Baldwin had been told the gun was “cold,” meaning it had no live ammunition. \nIn a sense, it is what polling is supposed to do in a democracy: give political actors insight into the will of the people, enabling decision makers to better re- spond to the demands of the electorate. \nSome polls in these states sug- gest a tightening race between Mr. Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, with one show- ing a virtual tie in Virginia, which has not voted for a Republican for president since 2004, and another showing Mr. Trump squeaking ahead in New Hampshire, which has not voted Republican since 2000. \nThe dismissal followed a dra- matic scene when the lead pros- ecutor, Kari T. Morrissey, went from questioning witnesses to tak- ing the stand herself. She gave an account of why a batch of ammu- nition that had been turned in to the state several months ago by a witness who claimed it was relat- ed to the “Rust” shooting had been put in an entirely different case file and was not handed over to the defense. \nAt the same time, it’s not obvi- ous that polling is up to the chal- lenge. \nPolls are inherently imprecise measurements, subject to count- less sources of uncertainty. While they continue to be the best way — or only way — to measure public opinion in a big, diverse country, polls have been wrong before, and they will be wrong again. \nOn Tuesday, the Cook Political Report, a prominent elections forecaster,  downgraded  New Hampshire and Minnesota from “likely” wins for Mr. Biden to only leaning in his direction. And in a meeting at the White House last week, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grish- am of New Mexico told Mr. Biden that she feared he would lose her state, according to two people briefed on her comments. \n“It was my impression that they did not match the live rounds from the set of ‘Rust,’” Ms. Morrissey said on the stand, saying that she had only viewed a photo of the am- munition. \nsimply “wrong.” He could retake the lead in the polling before November, of course, but given the stability in the polls so far, it may be unrealistic to expect such a pronounced shift toward him. Mr. Biden himself appears to be counting on the polls being “wrong.” In his interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC last week, he questioned whether polling was “as accurate as it used to be.” \nBut when the ammunition was brought into the courtroom earlier Friday at the judge’s request it be- Continued on Page A19 \nThe shakiness in the fringe bat- tleground states is an alarming sign for Mr. Biden’s hopes in must- win contests that were already ex- pected to be close, such as Michi- gan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

But companies are charging some people, especially in the middle of the country and parts of the southeast, far more than other homeowners with simi- lar levels of risk, an examination by The New York Times has shown. \n# \n# \n\nIs he right? Will the polls be wrong again? \nENID, Okla. — Surrounded by farms about 90 minutes north of Oklahoma City, Enid has an un- welcome distinction: Home insur- ance is more expensive, relative to home values, than almost any- where else in the country. Enid is hardly the American community that is most vulnera- ble to damaging weather. Yet as a share of home prices, insurance costs more in parts of Enid than in New Orleans, much of which is be- low sea level. More than in Para- dise, Calif., which was destroyed by the Camp fire in 2018. More \nIt’s extremely difficult to antic- ipate polling errors in advance.

Even more than in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where houses have begun slip- ping into the rising sea. Enid’s plight reveals an odd dis- tortion in America’s system of pricing home insurance. As a warming planet delivers increas- ingly damaging weather, the cost \nIndustry experts offer several reasons for the disparities, includ- ing the fact rural states have fewer homeowners to share risk, and states have varying rates of insurance fraud, which can drive up premiums. \nThe man was a constant pres- ence in the apartment, while other guards worked shifts and went out to the market, Mr. Kozlov said in an interview, from a hotel room in a Tel Aviv suburb a month after his rescue from captivity. \nHere’s what we do know about the state of the polling — and the likelihood of a polling misfire — heading into what could be a  Continued on Page A17 \nBut recent research points to a striking pattern: Higher premi- Continued on Page A12 \nDONORS RECOIL  Up to \\$90 million in pledges to a major Biden super PAC may be on hold.

Their main jailer had a rounded face, so they called him “Muhammad H’dudim,” Hebrew slang for “Mu- hammad Chubby Cheeks.” \nFurther Blurring Linesof Sales and Politics \n# \nFormer President Donald J. Trump hawks \\$59.99 Bibles with the same words he uses to win the votes of evangelical Christians. He sells swatches of the suit he wore in a mug shot while also rais- ing money for his campaign by calling himself a “political pris- oner.” He describes Truth Social, his refuge for those banned on other social media sites — and his best chance to substantially in- crease his wealth — as a bulwark against liberal companies out to silence Christians and conserva- tives. \nMr. Kozlov, 27, a Russian Israeli, provided an exceptionally de- tailed account of his total of eight months in captivity, together with Almog Meir Jan, 22, and Shlomi Ziv, 41. \nhas intertwined the marketing of his private business affairs with the messaging of his campaign, leveraging his political stature for profit. \nAll of it could be described as Martyr Inc., a machinery that makes Mr. Trump money and pro- motes his re-election by charac- terizing him as unjustly perse- cuted and selflessly saving his supporters from a similar fate.
