But Iranian leaders and Hamas officials im- mediately blamed Israel and \nIsraeli-controlled town on Satur- day that killed 12 children and teenagers. The strike on Beirut was the first time during this war that Israel has targeted such an influential Hezbollah leader in Lebanon’s capital. Hours later, the killing in Iran of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was considered the most brazen breach of Iran’s defenses in years. \n\nTaken together, the seniority of the targets, the sensitive location of the strikes and their near simultaneity were viewed as a particularly provocative escala- tion that has left the region fear- ing an even bigger response from Iran and its regional prox- ies, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq. The scale of that reaction could determine whether the low-level regional battle between Israel and the Iranian alliance tips into a full-scale, all-out con- flict. \nIn Tehran, protesting the as- sassination of Ismail Haniyeh. \nvowed to avenge the death of Mr. Haniyeh, heightening fears of a broader regional war. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatol- lah Ali Khamenei, issued an order for Iran to strike Israel directly, according to three Iranian offi- cials briefed on the order. And Iran’s new president, Ma- soud Pezeshkian, said in a state- ment on Wednesday, a day after he was sworn into office with Mr. Haniyeh seated in the front row: “We will make the occupying ter- rorist regime regret its action. Iran will defend its sovereignty, dignity, reputation and honor.” In recent years, Israel has car- ried out several high-profile as- sassinations in Iran, rattling the country’s leaders. In November, Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- yahu of Israel told reporters that he had ordered the Mossad, Is- rael’s foreign intelligence service, to “act against the heads of Ha- mas, wherever they are.” Hours before the killing of Mr. Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Is- raeli fighter jets had carried out a  Continued on Page A6 \nIranian military commanders are considering a large combina- tion attack of drones and ballistic missiles on military targets in Israel but would avoid striking civilian targets, three Iranian officials have said. Still, while Iran and Hezbollah are likely to respond, they may yet choose methods that give Israel room to avoid further retaliation, at least for now, some analysts said. For months, Hezbollah has appeared wary of a war that would quite likely devastate Lebanon, while Iran — whose leadership has already said it will respond forcefully — may want to avoid actions that draw the United States into the conflict more directly. Both par- ties may also decide to view each assassination as a distinct event, rather than as a combined attack that requires a massive, joint response, analysts said. Hezbollah will face pressure to \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \ngan in many places before the pandemic, suggesting that the po- lice have pulled back from a part of their job that has drawn espe- cially sharp criticism.

In other police de- partments that don’t publicly track stops, like Seattle’s and New York’s, the citations given during stops dropped off, too. The down- turn appears even among some state agencies that monitor road safety on highways, like the Texas Highway Patrol and the Connecti- cut State Police. \nThe defendants Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi reached the deal in talks with prosecutors across 27 months at Guantánamo and approved on Wednesday by a senior Pentagon official oversee- ing the war court. \nBut in the months and years that followed, a distinct pattern formed in many cities: The cars came back in full force, but the traffic enforcement didn’t. \nProsecutors said the deal was meant to bring some “finality and justice” to the case, particularly for the families of nearly 3,000 people who were killed in the at- tacks in New York City, at the Pen- tagon and in a Pennsylvania field. \nIt’s hard to draw a straight line from the decline of enforcement to the rise of road deaths, but their likely connection has unsettled re- Continued on Page A20 \nThe men have been in U.S. cus- tody since 2003.
