Upset by Removal of Posts Cited as Being Misinformation \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden was peeved. What was \nThe Democrats had just tempo- rarily averted a national default with Republican aid but still needed a broader deal to resolve a debt ceiling clash. Yet there was Mr. Schumer, the Senate Demo- cratic leader, on the floor bashing Republicans for playing   $\\mathrm{{}^{u}a}$   dan- gerous and risky partisan game.” Mr. Biden called Mr. Schumer to chide him. That was not helpful, the president said, according to an official informed about the call, which came late in Mr. Biden’s first year in office. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had backed down to help avoid a fiscal crisis. They should not rub his nose in it. Mr. Schumer pushed back. “You don’t know how much he’s been beating up on me,” he told the president. \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court handed the Biden ad- ministration a major practical vic- tory on Wednesday, rejecting a Republican challenge that sought to prevent the government from contacting social media platforms to combat what it said was misin- formation. \nThe court ruled that the states and users who had challenged those interactions had not suf- fered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue. \nThe decision, by a 6-to-3 vote, left for another day fundamental questions about what limits the First Amendment imposes on the government’s power to influence the technology companies that are the main gatekeepers of infor- mation in the internet era. \nBetween the Russian Offensives Photographs from Ukraine’s northeastern border regions, before the fighting renewed, reveal loss and transformation. Pages A6-7. \nThe Joe Biden who will defend his presidency at a nationally tele- vised debate on Thursday night remains a practitioner of old- school politics in a new-school era. The hostility, the anger, the polar- ization, the “beating up” that de- fine today’s national debate, yes, he knows all about that. But after more than half a cen- tury in Washington, he still has the instincts of a backslapping cloakroom pol, eager to make deals and work across the aisle where possible at a time when that rarely seems rewarded any- more. \nThe case arose from a barrage of communications from adminis- tration officials urging platforms to take down posts on topics like the  coronavirus  vaccine  and claims of election fraud. The attor- neys general of Missouri and Lou- isiana, both Republicans, sued, along with three doctors, the owner of a right-wing website that frequently traffics in conspiracy theories and an activist con- cerned that Facebook had sup- pressed her posts on the supposed side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. \n# \n# \ntion’s most closely watched pri- maries drove home an unmistak- able reality: Even at a moment when the war in Gaza has re-ener- gized progressive activism, many of the left’s candidates are no long- er gaining ground in major races, and in some cases they have started losing it. \n# \n# \nRepresentative Jamaal Bow- man’s upset win in a 2020 Demo- cratic primary in the New York suburbs was heralded by the left as proof of its electoral ascent in American politics. \n# \nSAN FRANCISCO — Last July, Google  made  an  eight-word change to its privacy policy that represented a significant step in its race to build the next genera- tion of artificial intelligence. Buried thousands of words into its document, Google tweaked the phrasing for how it used data for its products, adding that public in- formation could be used to train its A.I. chatbot and other services. \ndown by a unique collection of baggage, including a guilty plea to a misdemeanor for pulling a House fire alarm last year. And he faced record-shattering spending by political groups furious over his criticism of Israel. \nIn party primaries and special elections from Oregon to New Jer- sey, moderates seemed to be re- gaining their footing, often by ex- plicitly positioning themselves to the right of their Democratic op- ponents on immigration, foreign policy and public safety. President Biden has also tacked rightward on key issues like immigration. And in Missouri, another mem- ber of the “Squad,” Representa- tive Cori Bush, is in danger of los- ing an August primary, where many of the same forces that helped defeat Mr. Bowman are al- ready at play. \nIn some ways, it has been a for- mula for success that upended ex- pectations, resulting in a raft of landmark liberal programs that will mark Mr. Biden in the history books as one of the most prolific legislative masters since Lyndon  Continued on Page A22 \nFour years later, Mr. Bowman’s decisive loss on Tuesday will soon brand him with a more ignomini- ous distinction: the first member of  the  House’s  left-leaning “Squad” to be ousted from office. The congressman was weighed \n“The plaintiffs, without any concrete link between their inju- ries and the defendants’ conduct, ask us to conduct a review of the yearslong communications be- tween dozens of federal officials, across different agencies, with dif- ferent social media platforms, about different topics,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority. “This court’s standing doctrine prevents us from exercis- ing such general legal oversight of the other branches of govern- ment.” \n\n\n# \nWe use publicly available information to help train Google’s  language  AI  models and build  products and features like Google Translate , Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities \n“The voters in this district, and in other districts across the coun- try, frankly, are just not buying some of the things that these can- didates are selling,” said Jay Ja- cobs, New York’s Democratic Party chair, who has often been at war with his party’s left wing. “And now, moderate voters are getting engaged, they’re paying attention and they’re coming to the polls.” \nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thom- as and Neil M. Gorsuch, dis- sented. \n“For months,” Justice Alito wrote, “high-ranking government officials placed unrelenting pres- sure on Facebook to suppress Americans’ free speech. Because the court unjustifiably refuses to address this serious threat to the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.” \nThe subtle change was not unique to Google. As companies look to train their A.I. models on data that is protected by privacy laws, they’re carefully rewriting their terms and conditions to include words like “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning” and “genera- tive A.I.” \nDEBATE  A look back on televised presidential face-offs, including Richard Nixon’s sweaty contest with John F. Kennedy.  PAGE A21 \nThe outcome left progressives on the defensive on Wednesday, with longtime allies at odds over who was to blame and how — if at all — their movement needed to change its message and con- frontational style to meet a differ- ent moment in American politics. Other Democratic moderates in New York also were victorious on Tuesday, including John Avlon — whose political background in- cluded a stint as a speechwriter and adviser to Rudolph W. Giuli- ani — who won a House primary in eastern Long Island. But Mr.  Continued on Page A20 \nSURVEY  Republicans rallied be- hind Donald J. Trump after his conviction, a poll found.

Snap, for instance, warned its users not to share confidential information with its A.I. chatbot because it would be used in its training, and Meta alerted users in Europe that public posts on Facebook and Instagram would soon be used to train its large lan- guage model. \n# \n# \n# \nThe trial for Evan Gershkovich, an American reporter arrested 15 months ago, began Wednesday in a court near Moscow.

Though the precise toll was still being  tallied,  human  rights groups said that 23 people were killed and over 300 others injured after the police used tear gas and bullets to respond to demonstra- tors who had marched on Parlia- ment to protest the tax increases in the bill. \npass the legislation. The death toll makes Tuesday’s violence one of the bloodiest days in the country’s recent history. \nThose terms and conditions — which many people have long ig- nored — are now being contested by some users who are writers, il- lustrators and visual artists and worry that their work is being used to train the products that threaten to replace them. \n“Listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this finance bill, I concede, and therefore, I will not sign the 2024 finance bill, and it shall subse- quently be withdrawn,” Mr. Ruto said in an address to the country on Wednesday. \n# \ncalled for the destruction of Israel.
