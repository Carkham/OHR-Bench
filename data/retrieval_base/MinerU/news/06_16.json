Epstein ,  Maggie Haberman and  Jonathan Swan . \nBut it was just a temporary boost for Hamas, whose support among Gazans has been low for some time. And as the Israeli on- slaught has brought widespread devastation and tens of thousands of deaths, the group and its lead- ers have remained broadly unpop- ular in the enclave. More Gazans have even been willing to speak out against Hamas, risking retri- bution. \nOpponents of Donald J. Trump are drafting potential lawsuits in case he is elected in November and carries out mass deporta- tions, as he has vowed. One group has hired a new auditor to with- stand any attempt by a second Trump administration to unleash the Internal Revenue Service on them. Democratic-run state gov- ernments are even stockpiling abortion medication. \nIn interviews with nearly a doz- en Gaza residents in recent months, a number of them said they held Hamas responsible for starting the war and helping to bring death and destruction upon them, even as they blame Israel first and foremost. One Gazan, Raed al-Kelani, 47, said Hamas always acts in its own interests. \nA sprawling network of Demo- cratic officials, progressive activ- ists, watchdog groups and ex-Re- publicans has been taking ex- traordinary steps to prepare for a potential second Trump presiden- cy, drawn together by the fear that Mr. Trump’s return to power would pose a grave threat not just to their agenda but to American democracy itself. \n# \n# \nforms from a shopping mecca into a one-of-a-kind dance hall whose fame has spread across the country and beyond. \n“It started Oct. 7, and it wants to end it on its own terms,” said Mr. al-Kelani, who worked as a civil servant for the former Palestinian Authority government in Gaza, which was run by a rival faction to Hamas before Hamas seized con- trol of the territory in 2007. “But time is ticking with no po- tential hope of ending this,” he added. Mr. al-Kelani now makes meals and distributes food aid in shelters for displaced Gazans. “Hamas is still seeking its slice of power,” he said. “Hamas does not know how to get down from the tree it climbed.” \n# \n# \n“Trump has made clear that he’ll disregard the law and test the limits of our system,” said Joanna Lydgate, the chief executive of States United Democracy Center, a nonpartisan democracy watch- dog organization that works with state officials in both parties. “What we’re staring down is ex- tremely dark.” \nALAMO, Texas — The punish- ing heat of late spring does noth- ing to keep the crowds from descending on La Pulga de Alamo, one of the flea markets that are a center of ACROSS both commerce and THE culture in the Rio COUNTRY Grande Valley of \nChinese Athletes Failed More Than One Test \n\nwho began showing up for Alamo’s weekend dance after- noons and found themselves turning into internet celebrities. A local electrician known as El Divino Colombiano, the Divine Colombian, twirls in a pair of tight blue jeans and ruby-red, six-inch heels. A woman with lime-green feathers around her neck pushes a wheelchair onto the floor. In it is her mother, La Reynita de Oro, the Small Gold Queen, who waves her arms, festooned with gold bracelets, as the music swells. And then there’s the construction worker known as El Bronco because of his resemblance to the lead sing- er of the popular Mexican band  Continued on Page 16 \n# \nWhile the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an attempt to nullify federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, liberals fear a new Trump administration could rescind the approval or use a 19th-century morality law to criminalize sending it across state lines. \nThe tables and booths that spread across 70 acres, shaded under tarps and awnings, carry things that might not always be found at the local Walmart: spiro papa, an elaborate spiral of thinly sliced potatoes on a stick; the fragrant roasted corn cobs known as elotes asados; oversize statues of the Virgin of Guadalupe; piñatas that don’t quite resemble the Disney prin- cesses they are supposed to represent. \nAfter the revelation in April that 23 elite Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned sub- stance months before the last Summer Olympic Games, China and the global antidoping author- ity vigorously defended their deci- sions to allow them to compete in the Games in 2021. The swim- mers, they insisted, had not been doping. \nFor as long as anyone can remember, pulgas — Spanish for fleas — have been part of the fabric of El Valle, as the area is known to the large Spanish- speaking population in this part of Texas, a slice of Mexico just north of the border. This is never more true than on the weekend, when the market in Alamo trans- \nSome of the Gazans who spoke to The New York Times said that Hamas knew it would be starting a devastating war with Israel that would cause heavy civilian casu- alties, but that it did not provide any food, water or shelter to help people survive it. Hamas leaders  \nThe Democratic governor of Washington State, Jay Inslee, said he had secured a large enough supply of mifepristone pills to pre- serve access for women in his  Continued on Page 18 \nBut as they made those claims, China and the antidoping author- ity were both aware that three of those 23 swimmers had tested positive several years earlier for a different performance-enhancing drug and had escaped being pub- licly identified and suspended in that case as well, according to a secret report reviewed by The New York Times. \n# \n\nIn  both  instances,  China claimed that the swimmers had unwittingly ingested the banned substances,  an  explanation viewed with considerable skepti- cism by some antidoping experts. The two incidents add to long- standing suspicions among rival athletes about what they see as a pattern of Chinese doping and the unwillingness or inability of the global authority, the World Anti- \n# \nover race, class and ideology in the heart of a presidential election year. \nOcasio-Cortez of New York has declared the race her most press- ing electoral priority. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is slated to join her for a pre-election rally in the Bronx. And a powerful pro-Israel lobby working for the other side has already shattered spending records. \nOn one side, nearly the entire lo- cal Democratic establishment, in- cluding Mr. Sanders’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, has lined up be- hind Mr. Latimer, the Westchester County executive. So has the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby that has already spent \\$12 million — more than any other race in its his- tory — to try to defeat Mr. Bow- man over his criticism of Israel. On the other side, Ms. Ocasio- Cortez, the other members of the House’s left-wing “squad” and their progressive coalition are un- dertaking a desperate rescue mis- sion, draining bank accounts and leveling increasingly personal at- Continued on Page 20 \nThe three Chinese athletes re- vealed to have tested positive ear- lier, in 2016 and 2017, were no ordi- nary swimmers: Two would go on to win gold medals at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, and the third is now a world-record holder. All three are expected to contend for medals again at the Paris Games in July. \nThe House primary between Representative Jamaal Bowman, a left-wing Democratic darling, and George Latimer, a more mod- erate challenger, was always ex- pected to be a marquee showcase of their party’s divisions over the Israel-Hamas war. But with early voting under- way, the June 25 contest in New York has exploded into a proxy war for the Democratic Party’s fu- ture, tearing open old wounds \nAntidoping experts say that if Chinese officials and WADA had abided by existing rules with both sets of positive tests, the athletes would have been publicly identi- fied and subject to further scru- tiny, and could have been disquali- fied from the 2021 Olympics, and possibly the Games that open in Paris next month. \n# \nNative American groups see hope in small property transfers in California’s Owens Valley.
