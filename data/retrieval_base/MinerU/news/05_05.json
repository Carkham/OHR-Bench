There must be protest. \n# \n“You’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop,” he said. Soon the students would flood into a cam- pus administration building. That scene played out 60 years ago at the University of California, Berkeley. The words were di- rected at the university leader- ship, and referring to its restric- tions on campus political activity. But the speech, from the student leader Mario Savio, and the sit-in that followed could have hap- pened yesterday. \nBERLIN — The Russian Army is gradually expanding the role of women as it seeks to balance President Vladimir V . Putin’s pro- motion of traditional family roles with the need for new recruits for the war in Ukraine. \nThe military’s stepped-up ap- peal to women includes efforts to recruit female inmates in prisons, replicating on a much smaller scale a strategy that has swelled its ranks with male convicts. \nRecruiters in military uniforms toured Russian jails for women in the fall of 2023, offering inmates a pardon and   $\\S2{,}000$   a month  $-10$  times the national minimum wage — in return for serving in frontline roles for a year, according to six current and former inmates of three prisons in different regions of Russia. \nThe protests against Israel’s war in Gaza that have erupted on college campuses around the United States are merely the lat- est in a tradition of student-led, left-leaning activism dating back at least to the civil rights and anti- Vietnam War protests of the 1960s. \n# \nDozens of inmates just from those prisons have signed mili- tary contracts or applied to enlist, the women said, a sampling that — along with local media reports about recruitment in other re- gions — suggests a broader effort to enlist female convicts. \nOften, the protests have played out on college campuses, and sometimes in the same building as previous years: Hamilton Hall at Columbia University, was taken over by students in the protests of 1968 as well as this past week and at least four times in between. Sometimes the protests have seemed to be off-campus adapta- tions, like the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations of 2011 or the ra- cial justice demonstrations of re- cent years. \nyears later, she lives with her par- ents. Eventually diagnosed with brain damage, she cannot work, drive or even stand for long peri- ods of time. \namong the more harrowing, but thousands of Americans believe they suffered serious side effects following Covid vaccination. As of April, just over 13,000 vaccine-in- jury compensation claims had been filed with the federal govern- ment — but to little avail. Only 19 percent had been reviewed. Only 47 of those were deemed eligible for compensation, and only 12 had been paid out, at an average of about \\$3,600. \n# \n# \nWithin minutes of getting the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vac- cine, Michelle Zimmerman felt pain racing from her left arm up to her ear and down to her finger- tips. Within days, she was unbear- ably sensitive to light and strug- gled to remember simple facts. She was 37, with a Ph.D. in neu- roscience, and until then could ride her bicycle 20 miles, teach a dance class and give a lecture on artificial intelligence, all in the same day. Now, more than three \n# \n# \nIt’s not just convicts. Women now feature in Russian military recruitment  advertisements across the country. A pro-Kremlin paramilitary  unit  fighting  in Ukraine also recruits women. \n“When I let myself think about the devastation of what this has done to my life, and how much I’ve lost, sometimes it feels even too hard to comprehend,” said Dr. Zimmerman, who believes her in- jury was a result of a contami- nated vaccine batch. The Covid vaccines, a triumph of science and public health, are estimated to have prevented mil- \nlions  of  hospitalizations  and deaths. Yet even the best vaccines produce rare but serious side ef- fects. And the Covid vaccines have been given to more than 270 mil- lion people in the United States, in nearly 677 million doses. Dr. Zimmerman’s account is \n“Combat experience and mili- tary specialties are not required,” read an advertisement aimed at women that was posted in March in Russia’s Tatarstan region.

Mr. Putin has placed women at the core of this vision, portraying them as child-bearers, mothers and wives guarding the nation’s social harmony. \n# \n# \n“A symbol of human perfection,” a museum official declared that day. \nOlympics gave out medals in arts, not just athletics — and if you did- n’t know about that, the rest of this article may hold more surprises — the pinnacle came in Paris, 100 years ago this summer. \nThe statue did not stand still for long. Like the Olympic arts con- tests themselves, it went on quite a journey, largely to oblivion. For decades, beginning with the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, the Olympics included competitions in painting, sculpture, architec- ture, music and literature — a “pentathlon of the Muses,” as Pierre de Coubertin, the founder and  leader  of  the  modern Olympics, called them. “From now on they will be part of each Olympiad, on a par with the athletic competitions,” Cou- bertin said. \n“The most important thing for every women, no matter what profession she has chosen and what heights she has reached, is the family,” Mr. Putin said in a speech on March 8. \nThe gold medal sculpture at the 1924 Paris Olympics was by a Greek artist named Costas Dimi- triadis. His nude, arching, 7-foot “Discobole” (Discus Thrower) was for weeks displayed promi- nently in the Grand Palais. Two years later, before “a crowd of light-frocked women and straw- hatted men,” as The New York Times reported, the prized sculp- ture, cast in bronze, was planted just outside the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art in New York’s Central Park. \nThese clashing military and so- cial priorities have resulted in contradictory policies that seek to recruit women to the military to fill a need, but send conflicting sig- nals about the roles women can assume there. \n“I have gotten used to the fact that I am often looked at like a monkey, like, ‘Wow, she’s in fa- Continued on Page 8 \nOne Nostril Edges Out Another ... and Another Mystik Dan, ridden by the jockey Brian J.

The dual emergence of the two groups of cicadas is happening for the first time since 1803, and expected to last about six weeks. Any day now, scientists esti- mate, the state will be a carpet of buzzing, crawling, red-eyed in- \n“Some people think cicadas can suck your brains out,” said Willa, a red-haired 8-year-old in a Star Wars T-shirt. “They’re going to be so loud,” Christopher, 9, said as he colored his cicada intently. “I hate noise.” “It’s kind of scary,” Madison, 8, said while picking through mark- ers scattered on a green table. “What if they do something to \nme?” Not to worry, Madison and Willa: Cicadas don’t actually bite, and they prefer to suck tree sap. (And Christopher, earplugs might come in handy.) Illinois is the center of the cica- da emergence in the United States, the only state that will ex- perience cicadas nearly every- where and see two adjacent \n“What’s special about these two broods is that they cover almost the entirety of the state of Illinois,” said Allen Lawrance, associate curator of entomology at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Chicago. “So for us in Illinois, you won’t be able to get away from them.” \n# \nDES PLAINES, Ill. — As the third graders of Cumberland Ele- mentary in the Chicago suburbs colored, clipped and glued paper to make cicadas with filmy wings, they confided their fears about what is about to happen in Illinois. \nFans of cicadas say they evoke nostalgia: a sound of summer. \nContinued on Page 18 \nSUNDAY OPINION \n# \n# \n# \n# \nInvention and Exhibitionism About 170 million Americans use Tik- Tok, in an incalculable number of ways.
