Trump told officials on Monday that he supports a new Republican Party platform, one that reflects his new position on abortion rights and slims down policy specifics across all areas of government. \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday dared his critics to “challenge me at the conven- tion” if they want him out of the presidential race, refusing to step aside in a defiant letter to Demo- cratic members of Congress and in fiery remarks on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. \nThe new platform, as described to The New York Times by people briefed on it, cements Mr. Trump’s ideological takeover of the G.O.P The platform is even more nation- alistic, more protectionist and less socially conservative than the 2016 Republican platform that was duplicated in the 2020 elec- \nDeclaring himself “frustrated by the elites” who have called for his exit from the race, Mr. Biden engaged in an offensive blitz aimed at saving his candidacy. But it also did little to mollify rest- less Democratic lawmakers and laid bare the fractures in his party over whether his position as its standard-bearer would help or hurt its fortunes this fall. \nMr. Trump, who has had the draft for several days, called into a meeting of party officials on Mon- day and said that he supports it. The document overwhelmingly was approved during a vote by the platform committee on Monday, passing 84 to 18, according to a person briefed on the matter. The abortion section has been softened. There is no longer a ref- erence to “traditional marriage” as between “one man and one woman.” And there is no longer an emphasis on reducing the na- tional debt, only a brief line about “slashing wasteful government spending.” \nIn effect, Mr. Biden decided to engage in a no-holds-barred fight with his allies for the world to see. He was at turns defiant, furious, indignant, exasperated and dis- missive. He insisted that he would not withdraw from the race but ac- cused those who have suggested he step aside of being routinely wrong about politics. \nThe president used the friendly venue of the morning news show — hosted by Joe Scarborough, a longtime supporter who recently has been critical — to respond to demands that he demonstrate the kind of vigor that was missing from his listless and at times inco- herent debate performance on June 27. \nThe rest of the document re- flects Mr. Trump’s priorities as outlined on his campaign website: a hard-line immigration policy, in- cluding mass deportations; a pro- tectionist trade policy with new tariffs on most imports; and sec- tions on using federal power to re- move policies in academia, the military and throughout the U.S. government put in place by what it describes as radical Democrats. Mr. Trump and his top aides have alienated some activists by shutting them out of the develop- ment of the platform. The former president was especially focused on softening the language on abortion, the issue he views as his biggest vulnerability in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. A Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seek- \nMr. Biden raised his voice re- peatedly during the brief phone interview, including after Mika Brzezinski, the co-host of the show and Mr. Scarborough’s wife, asked him whether he had under- gone neurological exams after the debate. Sounding exasperated and angry, Mr. Biden rejected as- sertions that his stamina and mental abilities have not been tested in a real way. \n# \n# \n# \nanother adult were killed and at least 10 more people were injured, including seven children, local of- ficials said. At least three children were pulled from the rubble, Ukraine’s emergency services agency said. \n# \n# \nODESA, Ukraine — Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital was de- stroyed by a Russian missile on Monday, shaking Kyiv, the capital, with images of bloodied and in- jured children, and sending hun- dreds racing to the scene to help clear twisted metal and smashed concrete in a desperate search for survivors. \nIn the days after the debate with former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden tried to be con- ciliatory. He admitted that he had “a bad night” and tried to explain that his performance was the re- sult of a cold and jet lag. \nThe section on protecting hu- man life has been significantly watered down in the 2024 draft platform. In the 2016 and 2020 platforms, that section included extensive specific details about  Continued on Page A14 \nOlha Melnyk, the mother of a child being treated in the oncology unit of the hospital — who was not there at the time — said she was in a state of shock. \n# \ninjured. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 30 out of the 38 missiles launched by Russia dur- ing the attack, which began in the midmorning. \nPARIS — Instead of waking up on Monday to a country domi- nated by the far right, France awoke to becoming Italy, a coun- try where only painstaking par- liamentary negotiation may eventually yield a viable coalition government. \n“There were so many families like us, who had their own person- al war with oncology already,” she said. “And you know, these chil- dren can’t go to the basement, be- cause all the tubes and treat- ments. If they do this, there will be no healing at all. You can’t inter- Continued on Page A8 \n“The attack was massive, com- bined with the use of aerial, ballis- tic and cruise missiles,” said Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv mili- tary administration. “The mis- siles flew at the capital in waves and from different directions.” At the hospital, one doctor and \nContinued on Page A15 \nThe hospital strike was part of a barrage of bombings by Moscow across the country, including one of its deadliest assaults on Kyiv since the first months of the war.

The bags were leaky, they said, and risked making a greasy mess. Their edges were prone to split- ting open. “Chicken juice spilled all over the trunk of our car!” one person complained on Reddit. It was another chapter in the \nWith the Paris Olympics set to open in less than three weeks, and an August exodus to the beaches or mountains a sacred feature of French life, talks to form a government may stretch into the fall, when France will need a government to pass a budget. The election, which might have provoked an upris- ing, produced an impasse. The New Popular Front, a resurgent if fractious left-wing alliance, came in first with about 180 seats in the National Assem- bly and immediately demanded that President Emmanuel Ma- cron ask it to form a government, saying it would put forward its choice of prime minister in the next week. \nCostco puts chickens in bags instead of bulky containers. \nThere is broad agreement that the world needs to use less plastic. Plastic waste is filling the world’s landfills and clogging rivers and streams. Recycling hasn’t kept up; less than 10 percent of plastic waste gets recycled. Plastic can also contain chemicals linked to cancer and other health problems. Reining in plastic packaging — often used only once, then thrown away — is an obvious first step. But putting that into practice has been tricky for businesses, policy- \nmakers and shoppers. Everyone has an opinion. \n“You can see experiments all over the landscape with   $\\mathrm{it},\\!,$   said Sandra Goldmark, a sustainabili- ty expert at Columbia University’s Climate School. “Right now many of the experiments are not work- ing that well. We haven’t really cracked this nut.” \nCostco’s rotisserie-chicken-in- a-bag was a classic example of a  Continued on Page A20 \nThis demand ignored several  Continued on Page A7 \nClearing rubble at a children’s hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine, destroyed by a Russian missile on Monday. \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \nStalking Sri Lanka’s Men Climate change and contaminated water have combined to create an epidemic of kidney disease.
