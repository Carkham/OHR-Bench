GRYNBAUM \nMSNBC placed a big bet on be- coming comfort TV for liberals. Then it doubled down. \nTime slots on the cable network once devoted to news program- ming are now occupied by Trump- bashing opinion hosts. The chan- nel has become a landing spot for high-profile alumni of President Biden’s administration like Jen Psaki, who went from hosting White House press briefings to hosting her own show. On Super Tuesday, when producers aired a portion of a live speech by former President Donald J. Trump, Ra- chel  Maddow  chastised  her bosses on the air. \nThe moves have been a hit with viewers. MSNBC has leapfrogged past its erstwhile rival CNN in the ratings and has seen viewership rise over the past year, securing second place in cable news behind the perennial leader, Fox News. But MSNBC’s success has had unintended consequences for its parent company, NBC, an original Big Three broadcaster that still strives to appeal to a mass Ameri- can audience. \nSecurity officials scrambled after getting Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia into a car and tackling a suspect behind a metal barrier. \n# \n# \nlowers with whom he shares a last name — his family. “She said: ‘I’m demanding \\$500.

Local NBC sta- tions between the coasts have de- manded, again and again, that ex- ecutives in New York do more to preserve  NBC’s  nonpartisan brand, lest MSNBC’s blue-state bent alienate their red-state view- ers. \n# \n# \nThe  Instagram  message popped up from a girl named Chelsea: “Howdy.” \nDavid didn’t know anyone named Chelsea, but he clicked through her profile: She had brown hair and a nice smile; un- der her name was a quote from the Bible. He thought it was sort of weird that she was messaging him, a stranger, in the middle of a workday, but her pouty selfies made that easy to ignore. \nThis article is by  Cassandra Vino- grad ,  Andrew Higgins  and  Richard Pérez-Peña . \ncian, got carried away. When she asked him for a nude, he hardly thought twice, he said. He slipped into the bathroom at the New Jer- sey hospital where he works, took a picture and hit send. Within seconds, the threats be- gan. \nBut there was no Chelsea. The real person behind the account, David said, was a man who, over the course of three fraught days, inadvertently revealed he was in Nigeria as he demanded hun- dreds of dollars to keep David’s pictures private. As he paid up, David joined the thousands of other people cowed under a new scam that has exploded over the  Continued on Page A16 \nA gunman shot Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, who is known for defying his fellow lead- ers in the European Union, multi- ple times at close range on Wednesday, in the most serious attack on a European leader in decades. \nEven Comcast, NBC’s corpo- rate owner, which is loath to inter- vene in news coverage, took the rare step of conveying its concern to MSNBC’s leaders when some hosts and guests criticized Israel as the Hamas attack was unfold- ing on Oct. 7, according to three people with knowledge of the dis- cussions. An abrupt course cor- rection to that coverage followed. This account of the tensions roiling NBC and its corporate overseers is based on interviews with more than two dozen people with knowledge of the company’s inner workings, almost all of whom insisted on anonymity to share details of internal discus- sions. \nHe was hesitant when she asked him to chat, but soon her flirty messages escalated to a vol- ley of explicit pictures, and David, a 32-year-old pharmacy techni- \nDavid’s phone lit up with mes- sages: pictures he had sent with his genitals exposed alongside screenshots of his Instagram fol- \nMr. Fico was shot after emerg- ing from the House of Culture in Handlova, a town in central Slo- vakia, as he greeted a small crowd in Banikov Square. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, then airlifted to another hospital for emergency surgery. \n\nHours later, the deputy prime minister, Tomas Taraba, told the BBC that Mr. Fico’s situation was no longer life-threatening, and he expected the prime minister to survive. \nThe gunman, identified by Slo- vak news outlets as a 71-year-old poet, was immediately wrestled to the ground by security officers. The interior minister, Matus Su- taj Estok, said at a news confer- ence that Mr. Fico was shot five times and that the initial evidence “clearly points to a political moti- vation.” Asked to name the at- tacker, he said, “Not today.” The attempted assassination stoked fears that Europe’s in- creasingly polarized and ven- omous  political  debates  had tipped into violence. \nNBC declined to make its top executives available for inter- views. The chairman of the NBC- Universal News Group, Cesar Conde, has said he wants his divi- sion  —  which  encompasses MSNBC, CNBC, a digital stream- ing service, Telemundo and jour- nalistic stalwarts like “Nightly News,” “Meet the Press” and “To- day” — to be a big tent. \nYet his recent efforts to include more conservative voices on the airwaves generated newsroom suspicion and ultimately led to an embarrassing rebellion over the hiring of Ronna McDaniel, a for- mer Republican Party chair who aided Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. MSNBC hosts, for their part,  \nMr. Fico began his three-decade political career as a leftist but over the years shifted to the right. He served as prime minister from 2006 to 2010 and from 2012 to 2018, before returning to power in elec- tions last year.

Trump have agreed to two de- bates, one on June 27 on CNN and one on Sept. 10 on ABC News, the first onstage clashes between the \nformer president and his succes- sor in more than three years. While some of the details were still being hammered out, the agreement to the two debates, reached in a series of social-media posts Wednesday morning, raises the likelihood of the earliest general-election debate in mod- ern history and immediately de- livered a jolt of electricity to a campaign that had settled into something of a rut. \nBoth Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden believe firmly that if the American people get a look at their opponent \non a debate stage they will be less likely to vote for them. Mr. Biden opened the exchange on Wednesday by saying he was willing to debate Mr. Trump twice before the election, and as early as June, but on the condition that the arrangements bypassed the non- partisan organization that has managed presidential debates since 1988. \nMr. Biden and his top aides want the debates to start much sooner than the dates proposed by the organization, the Commission on Presidential Debates, so voters can see the two candidates side by side well before early voting be- \n\nPresident Biden proposed having no in-person audience. \ngins in September. They want the debate to occur inside a TV studio, with microphones that automati- cally cut off when a speaker’s time limit elapses. \nAnd they want it to be just the two candidates and the moderator — without the raucous in-person audiences that Mr. Trump feeds on and without the participation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or other in- dependent or third-party candi- dates. \nIt remains unclear whether the Trump campaign will agree to the Biden campaign’s proposed rules, including the mic cutoff and lack of an audience. \nBefore the Biden campaign’s debate  proposal  Wednesday  Continued on Page A18 \n# \nhealing, grief, friendship, mastec- tomy, and therapy — often selling courses, supplements or eating plans as if they were talismans to help safeguard their path. “Journey” has decisively taken its place in American speech.
