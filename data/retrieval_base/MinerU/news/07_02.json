Trump’s statements on Jan. 6, 2021, amounted to official or unofficial conduct. \n# \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court ruled on Monday that former President Donald J. Trump is entitled to substantial immunity from prosecution on charges of trying to overturn the last election, a blockbuster deci- sion in the heat of the 2024 cam- paign that vastly expanded presi- dential power. \nacts,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, re- gardless of politics, policy or party.” \nThe alternative, the chief jus- tice wrote, is to invite tit-for-tat political reprisals. \n“Virtually every president is criticized for insufficiently enforc- ing some aspect of federal law (such as drug, gun, immigration or  environmental  laws),”  he wrote. “An enterprising prosecu- tor in a new administration may assert that a previous president violated that broad statute. With- out immunity, such types of pros- ecutions of ex-presidents could quickly become routine.” \nThe vote was 6 to 3, dividing along partisan lines. Its immedi- ate practical effect will be to fur- ther complicate the case against Mr. Trump, with the chances that it will go before a jury ahead of the election now vanishingly remote and the charges against him, at a minimum, narrowed. \nThe decision amounted to a powerful statement by the court’s conservative majority that presi- dents should be insulated from the potential that actions they take in carrying out their official duties could later be used by political en- emies to charge them with crimes. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said Mr. Trump had at least presump- tive immunity for his official acts. He added that the trial judge must undertake an intensive factual re- view to separate official and unof- ficial conduct and to assess whether prosecutors can over- come the presumption protecting Mr. Trump for his official conduct. If Mr. Trump prevails at the polls, the issue could become moot since he could order the Justice Department to drop the charges. The liberal wing, in some of the harshest dissents ever filed by Su- preme Court justices, said the ma- jority had created a kind of king not answerable to the law. Broad immunity for official con- duct is needed, the chief justice wrote, to protect “an energetic, in- dependent executive.” \nIn dissent, Justice Sonia So- tomayor wrote that the decision was gravely misguided. In a rare move and sign of deep disagree- ment, she summarized her dis- sent from the bench, making off- the-cuff remarks that under- scored her frustration. \n“Today’s decision to grant for- mer presidents criminal immuni- ty reshapes the institution of the presidency,” she wrote. “It makes a mockery of the principle, foun- dational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law.” \nIn her own dissent, Justice Ke- tanji Brown Jackson wrote that “the court has now declared for the first time in history that the most powerful official in the United States can (under circum- stances yet to be fully deter- mined) become a law unto him- self.” \n# \npart of the court’s decision, might take place or how long it would last. \nas long as possible. And if he wins the presidency again, he could avoid the proceeding altogether by ordering his Justice Depart- ment to drop the entire case. But if Judge Chutkan sticks to her practice of dealing quickly with procedural matters and is able to schedule the hearing for September or October, it could lead to something extraordinary: a mini-trial of sorts unfolding in the nation’s capital in what could be the homestretch of the presi- dential campaign. \n# \n# \nThe Supreme Court’s decision on Monday about executive im- munity makes it all but certain that former President Donald J. Trump will not stand trial on charges of seeking to overturn the last election before voters decide whether to send him back to the White House in the next one. But the ruling also opened the door for prosecutors to detail much of their evidence against Mr. Trump in front of a federal judge — and the public — at an ex- pansive fact-finding hearing, per- haps before Election Day. It remains unclear when the hearing, which was ordered as \nBut it will address the big ques- tion that the justices kicked back to the trial court, which is how much of Mr. Trump’s indictment can survive the ruling that former presidents enjoy immunity for of- ficial actions they take in office. And it will be held in Federal Dis- trict Court in Washington in front of the judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, who was handling the case before it was frozen more than six months ago as a series of courts considered his immunity claims. Almost from the moment that Judge Chutkan was assigned the case, she moved it forward expe- ditiously, showing little patience \n# \nMr. Trump embraced the out- come on social media, celebrating the ruling. “Big win for our consti- tution and democracy,” he wrote in all-capital letters. “Proud to be an American!” \nfor Mr. Trump’s efforts to delay it — or his complaints that it was getting in the way of his cam- paign. At one point, she told the former president that his “day job” as a candidate would not affect her ad- ministration of the case, later de- claring, “This trial will not yield to the election cycle.” Mr. Trump’s lawyers will no doubt seek to narrow the scope of the proceeding and push it off for \nMr. Biden’s campaign focused on the events of Jan. 6 and nodded to Mr. Trump’s recent conviction in New York on falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal.
