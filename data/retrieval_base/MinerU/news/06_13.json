It branded Israel’s assault on the territory a “genocide,” and the leaders of her university re- sponded by urging her to resign. That was soon after the war be- gan on Oct. 7. Months later, the professor drew even more scru- tiny for saying it was time to “abol- ish Zionism” and accusing Israel of politicizing rape. She was briefly suspended in March by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she has taught law and so- cial work for nearly three dec- ades. But right-wing Israeli poli- ticians demanded more severe punishment, and in April, the po- lice detained her overnight. “I have been persecuted and de- famed, my academic production of knowledge flattened, and my home and even my own bedroom invaded,” Professor Shalhoub- Kevorkian, 64, told The New York Times. The professor is now under in- vestigation for incitement to ter- rorism — a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. And though she has not been charged, her case has prompted a profound debate inside Israel about the re- pression of free speech and aca- demic freedom since the war be- gan more than eight months ago. The professor’s lawyers say she is being punished for her political views. And some other Israeli pro- fessors and students worry that the  country’s  universities  — which had long defended the val- ues of relative diversity and open- mindedness — have contributed to the suppression of dissent. While universities argue they are simply trying to keep cam- puses calm, critics say there is a clear double standard across Is- raeli society: Violent rhetoric to- ward Palestinians from Jewish Is- raelis is often brushed aside, while Palestinian citizens of Israel who express support for Palestinians in Gaza or criticize the conduct of the war face discipline or even criminal investigation. As of May, police records show, 162 indictments for incitement to terrorism had been filed since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Nearly every case, according to Adalah, a legal center for the rights of the Arab minority in Is- rael, involved Arab citizens of Is- rael or Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, who mostly de- clined offers of citizenship after Is- Continued on Page A8 \n# \nKYIV, Ukraine — Towering over Kyiv for six decades, Hotel Ukraine has witnessed some piv- otal moments in Ukraine’s recent history. \nCrowds gathered on the square in front of the 14-story hotel to cel- ebrate the fall of the Soviet Union. Popular uprisings on what was later called Independence Square toppled Ukrainian leaders. Today, blue and yellow flags cover lawns near the hotel, serving as a re- minder of the many lives lost in the war between Ukraine and Russia. \nNow, Hotel Ukraine is up for auction as part of an effort to sell off some large state assets to help fund the military and bolster an \n\n# \nwas expensive.

Another foreigner chasing an- other record had hired him as a guide. This time, it was Gina Marie Rzucidlo, who was try- ing to become the first American woman to climb the world’s tallest mountains. Another American woman, also guided by a Sherpa, was climbing separately in pursuit of the same record. \nKATHMANDU, Nepal — In July 2023, the mountaineer Tenjen Lama Sherpa guided a Norwegian climber to summit the world’s 14 highest peaks in record time. In a sport that de- mands an alchemy of sinewy resolve and high- altitude faith, Mr. Lama did everything his cli- ent did and more. But she received most of the money, fame and attention. \nThe view from the state-owned Hotel Ukraine, which is up for auction starting at \\$25 million. \nThe kind of lucrative endorsements enjoyed by foreign athletes are not usually given to Ne- pal’s ethnic Sherpas. For them, the profession of Himalayan guide offers a path out of deep pov- erty, but also a possible route — strewn with av- alanches and icefalls — to a premature death. Mr. Lama could not afford to rest after guid- ing the Norwegian, he told The New York Times.

Beginning this summer, the government will auction some 20 state-owned companies, including Hotel Ukraine, a vast shopping mall in Kyiv, and several mining and chemical companies.

He was 86. The Los Angeles Clippers an- nounced his death but provided no other details. West was a consult- ant for the team in recent years. For four decades, first as a play- er and later as a scout, a coach and an executive, West played a formi- dable role in the evolution of the N.B.A. in general and the Lakers in particular, beginning in 1960, when the team moved from Min- neapolis to Los Angeles and he was its first draft choice. He won championships with several generations of Laker teams and Laker stars and was an All-Star in each of his 14 seasons. But except for his longtime team- mate, the great forward Elgin Baylor, who retired without a championship, there may have never been a greater player who suffered the persistent close-but- no-cigar frustration that followed West for the bulk of his career on the court. \n# \n“The budget is in the red,” Olek- siy Sobolev, Ukraine’s deputy  Continued on Page A10 \nSaudi  Arabia  has  already launched a hostile takeover of pro- fessional golf.

The vote was an indication that evangeli- cals are increasingly open to argu- ments that equate embryos with human life, and that two years af- ter the overturning of Roe v. Wade, “fetal personhood” may be the next front for the anti-abortion movement. \nday was the first time that attend- ees at the Southern Baptist meet- ing have addressed the ethics of in vitro fertilization directly. The resolution proposed on Wednesday called on Southern Baptists “to reaffirm the uncondi- tional value and right to life of ev- ery human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation, especially in the number of em- bryos generated in the I.V.F. process.” \nUnder the Saudi proposal, about 200 of the top men’s boxers in the world would be signed and then divided into 12 weight classes in what would amount to a global boxing league. \nMore than 10,000 delegates, called “messengers,” have gath- ered in Indianapolis for the de- nomination’s  annual  meeting, which is closely watched as a ba- rometer of evangelical sentiment on a variety of cultural and politi- cal issues.
