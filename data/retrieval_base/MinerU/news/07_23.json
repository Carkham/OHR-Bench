No. 60,224 © 2024  The New York Times Company TUESDAY, JULY 23, 2024 \n\n# \n# \nVice President Kamala Harris raised \\$81 million in her first 24 hours as a candidate to lead the Democratic Party’s presidential ticket. \n# \nabout her friendship with Mr. Bi- den’s son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and com- mended the president’s “deep love of our country.” \nPresident Kamala Harris drew on her past as a prosecutor on Mon- day in her first campaign appear- ance  since  President  Biden dropped his re-election bid, say- ing her law enforcement back- ground would help her defeat a ri- val who is a convicted criminal. Speaking from what had been the Biden-Harris campaign head- quarters in Wilmington, Del., Ms. Harris said her experience as a prosecutor in California gave her insight into former President Donald J. Trump. \nBut she wasted no time in start- ing to build her new profile as the presumptive nominee and the new hope among Democrats for defeating Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris raised \\$81 million in her first 24 hours as a presidential candidate, began an effort to engage dele- gates and scooped up key en- dorsements. \nIn the three and a half months until Election Day, Ms. Harris still needs to define herself for the American people before Republi- cans do it for her. She also needs to quickly take over the campaign apparatus that Mr. Biden had spent more than a year building. Stefanie Brown James, a co- founder of the Collective PAC, an organization that supports Black candidates at all levels of govern- ment, quoted the rapper Jay-Z when describing the current mo- ment for Ms. Harris. \n“I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” Ms. Harris told a crowd of campaign staff members. “Preda- tors who abused women. Fraud- sters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” \nMs. Harris made a point to praise Mr. Biden, even as she tried to reintroduce herself to Ameri- cans on her own terms. The presi- dent, who has been recovering from Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., called in to the event at campaign headquar- ters, which featured “Kamala” and “Harris for President” post- ers. \n“‘Allow me to reintroduce my- self,’” Ms. James said. “She has to in this moment define who she is, explain her record.” \nBut Ms. James also said Ms. Harris would need to form an ef- fective message that used her work as a vice president and pros- ecutor to energize voters, some- Continued on Page A12 \n“I’m hoping you’ll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala,” Mr. Biden told the staff before Ms. Harris spoke. At one point, Mr. Biden spoke to his vice president di- rectly. “I’m watching you, kid,” Mr. Biden said. “I love you.” Before she previewed her cam- paign in Wilmington, Ms. Harris paid tribute to Mr. Biden during an event honoring college athletes at the White House. She talked \nLOOKING BACK  Some say the president’s decision will enhance his role in posterity.  PAGE A18 \nLOOKING AHEAD  Kamala Harris’s first big decision is choosing a potential running mate.

Trump within hours of President Bi- \nASPEN, Colo. — As President Biden greeted the leaders of his 31 allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a week ago, he de- scribed in vivid terms how he thought history would treat his first term in office. He was the American president who had restored and then ex- panded NATO, the world’s biggest military alliance, saving it from his predecessor’s threats to with- draw from it. He organized the West to push back against Presi- dent Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and in so doing deterred Moscow from direct attacks on European nations beyond Ukraine’s bor- ders. And he became the architect of a new American plan to contain China, though he never calls it that: cutting off sophisticated technology to Beijing while pour- \nGender and Crime \nWASHINGTON — “I need you and Mike at the house,” President Biden said Saturday afternoon. Mr. Biden was on the phone from his vacation home in Re- hoboth, Del., with Steve Ricchetti, a counselor to the president and one of his closest advisers. He was referring to Mike Donilon, his chief strategist and longtime speechwriter. Soon, both men were in Rehoboth, socially dis- tanced from the president, who was recovering from Covid. From that afternoon and far into the night, the three worked on one of the most important and his- toric letters of Mr. Biden’s presi- dency — the announcement of his decision to withdraw from his re- election campaign after top Dem- \non Sunday, Too \nANALYSIS day, fundamen- tally rewiring the presidential contest at warp \ning billions of federal dollars into producing advanced chips at home. \nocrats, donors, close allies and friends had pressured him relent- lessly to get out. \nthe ultimate X-factor. Mr. Biden quickly endorsed Ms. Harris, who would be a barrier-breaking nominee as the first woman, the first Black wom- an and the first person of South Asian descent ever to serve as president. As the Democratic Party ral- lies behind her — the loudest voices of dissent were simply those not publicly endorsing her — here are six ways her candi- dacy holds both promise and peril. \nBut Mr. Biden’s defense of his record came too late, after his shocking  debate  performance that led to his withdrawal from the race on Sunday. And now it will fall to a different nominee — probably but not certainly Vice President Kamala Harris — to defend that record from a radically different interpretation of the past four years promoted by former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump. Continued on Page A7 \nHe would not tell most of his staff until a minute before making the announcement to the world on social media on Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Mr. Biden went on to endorse, spoke to him earlier on Sunday morning, as did Jeff Zients, his chief of staff, and Jen O’Malley Dillon, his campaign chair.

Some Democratic donors who are not immediately supporting Ms. Harris — including former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Silicon Valley lead- ers such as Reed Hastings and Vinod Khosla — called for a com- petitive process, which Democrat- ic donors and fund-raisers have been interpreting as something of a code to say they are not eager to support Ms. Harris against for- mer President Donald J. Trump. “The decision is too important to rush because the election is too important to lose,” Mr. Bloomberg said on Monday. \n# \n# \nFor decades, Kamala Harris has been bolstered by a tight-knit group of female donors who rose up with her in Democratic politics. And for weeks, even when she was still insisting that President Biden would be the party’s nomi- nee, these allies began to make moves to make sure her historic campaign would not be built on the fly. \n# \nOn Sunday, when Mr. Biden an- nounced his exit from the race and endorsed Vice President Harris, all the behind-the-scenes maneu- vering appeared to pay off. The nation’s highest-ranking female officeholder, Ms. Harris rapidly picked up pivotal endorsements without attracting a single serious challenger. Money started flood- ing in. Ads began moving. And while some major Democratic do- nors remained on the hunt for a \nQuickly and quietly, her biggest supporters worked to rally sup- port around her, creating enough momentum to effectively stamp out any opposition. They collected money, cut ads in advance and worked their networks to monitor the moves of other hopefuls. \n# \nKimberly Cheatle couldn’t explain the failure to protect former President Donald Trump.
