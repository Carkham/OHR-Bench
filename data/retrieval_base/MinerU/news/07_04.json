Trump’s lead in the 2024 presidential race has wid- ened after President Biden’s fum- bling debate performance last week, as concerns that Mr. Biden is too old to govern effectively rose to new heights among Demo- crats and independent voters, a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College showed. \nWASHINGTON — President Biden has told key allies that he knows the coming days are cru- cial and understands that he may not be able to salvage his candi- dacy if he cannot convince voters that he is up to the job after a dis- astrous debate performance last week. \nAccording to two allies who have spoken with him, Mr. Biden has emphasized that he is still deeply committed to the fight for re-election but understands that his viability as a candidate is on the line. \nMr. Trump now leads Mr. Biden 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally, a three- point swing toward the Republi- can from just a week earlier, be- fore the debate. It is the largest lead Mr. Trump has recorded in a Times/Siena poll since 2015. Mr. Trump leads by even more among registered voters, 49 percent to 41 percent. \nThe president sought to project confidence on Wednesday in a call with his campaign staff, even as White House officials were trying to calm nerves among the ranks inside the Biden administration. “No one’s pushing me out,” Mr. Biden said in the call. “I’m not leaving.” \nDoubts about Mr. Biden’s age and acuity are widespread and growing. A majority of every dem- ographic, geographic and ideolog- ical group in the poll — including Black voters and those who said they will still be voting for him — believe Mr. Biden, 81, is too old to be effective. \n# \n# \nVice President Kamala Harris was also on the line. \n“We will not back down. We will follow our president’s lead,” she said. “We will fight, and we will win.” \nhis mother was yet to be found. He bent over to pick up his daughter for one last embrace. Bhumi wore a yellow top, and her hair was tied in a ponytail with a pink band. “Let her sleep,” Nitin, Mr. Ku- mar’s oldest son, told him, pulling the girl away from his father to lay her back on the slab so they could continue the search. \n# \nOverall, 74 percent of voters view him as too old for the job, up five percentage points since the debate. Concerns about Mr. Bi- den’s age have spiked eight per- centage points among Democrats in the week since the debate, to 59 percent. The share of independent voters who said they felt that way rose to 79 percent, nearly match- ing the Republican view of the president. \nSOKHANA, India — Vinod Ku- mar was away from home on Tuesday, as he usually is for days at a time in search of masonry work, when he got the dreadful call. \nStill, Mr. Biden’s allies said that the president had privately ac- knowledged that his next few ap- pearances heading into the July 4 holiday weekend must go well, particularly an interview sched- uled for Friday with George Ste- phanopoulos of ABC News and campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \nIn Britain, Starmer Yanks Labour to the Center \n42, and daughter, Bhumi, 9, at the government hospital in Hathras, laid out on large slabs of ice among the dozens others in the corridor. \nAll the women in his family, three generations of them, were dead, crushed in a stampede. For the rest of the day, Mr. Ku- mar and his three sons went from hospital to hospital searching for their loved ones among the bodies of the 121 people who had died when a large gathering of a spiri- tual guru broke into deadly panic. Close to midnight, they found the bodies of his wife, Raj Kumari, \n“I don’t know when I will find my mother’s body,” he said, mov- ing on with the search. “I want to do their last rites together.” Mr. Kumar’s mother, Jaimanti, was the family’s matriarch. And she was its main devotee to the guru, keeping his posters at home and frequenting his sermons.

That person, who talked to the president in the past 24 hours, spoke on the condition of ano- nymity to discuss a sensitive situ- ation. \n“Why did you leave me just like that? Who will scold the children now and push them to go to school?” Mr. Kumar wailed at the feet of his wife. But he couldn’t afford to be en- tirely lost in grief yet. The body of \nThe poll offers early empirical evidence of what many Demo- crats have feared: that Mr. Biden’s faltering debate performance has further imperiled his chances against Mr. Trump this fall.

But it was entirely in character for Mr. Starmer, a 61- year-old former human rights lawyer who still behaves less like a politician than a prosecutor bringing a case. \n\nA new poll from The New York Times and Siena College showed that former President Donald J. Trump now leads Mr. Biden 49 percent to 43 percent among likely voters nationally, a three- point swing toward the Republi- can from just a week earlier, be- fore the debate. The six-point deficit underscored the growing challenges to the campaign and could make it harder to hang on, although some insiders had wor- Continued on Page A16 \nEarnest, intense, practical and not brimming with charisma, Mr. Starmer finds himself on the cusp of a potential landslide victory without the star quality that marked previous British leaders on the doorstep of power, whether Margaret Thatcher, the 1980s free-market champion, or Tony Blair, the avatar of “Cool Britan- nia.” \nSource: Based on a New York Times/Siena  College poll of 1,532 voters nationwide  conducted from June 28 to July 2, 2024 | Note: The margin of error for likely voters is +/- 2.9   points. For registered voters it is +/- 2.8 points. \n# \nAnd yet Mr. Starmer has man- aged an arguably comparable po- litical feat: Less than a decade af- ter entering Parliament, and less than five years after his party suf- fered its worst election defeat since the 1930s, he has remade La- bour with ruthless efficiency into an electable party, pulling it to the center on key policies while capi- talizing on the failings of three Conservative prime ministers. “Don’t forget what they have done,” Mr. Starmer told a rally in London on Saturday, pacing the stage in a pressed white shirt with sleeves rolled up. “Don’t forget party-gate, don’t forget the Covid contract, don’t forget the lies, don’t forget the kickbacks.” In listing this parade of Conser- vative scandals and crises, he brought the crowd of 350 to its  \nThousands Evacuate California Fire A wildfire that began Tuesday north of Sacramento has burned more than 3,000 acres.

Is it riskier to go with a new candidate or stick with a president who appears headed for defeat? \n“It’s good for the environment, and we make sure the public knows about it,” said Sean Hast- ings, a resource protection coordi- nator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a founder of the award program, which was created by a coalition of national marine sanctuaries, air quality districts and other non- profit groups. “That’s the motiva- Continued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nEvery year, in the waters off the California coast, hundreds of tankers, car carriers and con- tainer vessels from dozens of ship- ping companies take part in an un- usual race. \n# \nNo presumptive nominee has withdrawn this late in the process.
