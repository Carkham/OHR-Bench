Four men in black tactical gear pinned him, his face to the con- crete, to cuff his hands behind his back. \nbehind bars as in hospitals. Esti- mating the population of incarcer- ated people with major psycholog- ical problems is difficult, but the number is likely 200,000 to 300,000, experts say. \nMany of these institutions re- main ill-equipped to handle such a task, and the burden often falls on prison staff and health care per- sonnel who struggle with the dual roles of jailer and caregiver in a high-stress, dangerous, often de- humanizing environment. \nHe did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change. \n“I didn’t do anything,” Mr. John- son moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders. It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6, 2019, in the Danville Correctional Cen- ter, a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson, 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession, was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated, but hardly unwatched. He had entered in good health, with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previ- ous three weeks, Mr. Johnson, who suffered from bipolar dis- order and schizophrenia, had re- fused to eat or take his medica- tion. Most dangerous of all, he had stealthily stopped drinking water, hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises. \nIn 2021, Joshua McLemore, a 29-year-old with schizophrenia held for weeks in an isolation cell in Jackson County, Ind., died of or- gan failure resulting from a “re- fusal to eat or drink,” according to an autopsy. In April, New York City agreed to pay \\$28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Nicholas Feliciano, a young man with a history of mental ill- ness who suffered severe brain damage after attempting to hang himself on Rikers Island — as cor- rectional officers stood by.

Many seriously ill people receive no treatment. For those who do, the outcome is often determined by the vigilance and commitment of individual supervisors and frontline staff, which vary greatly from system to system, prison to prison, and even shift to shift. The country’s jails and prisons have become its largest provider of inpatient mental health treat- ment, with 10 times as many seri- ously mentally ill people now held \n\nrestless,  relentless  innovator whose explorations of color and form made him an outsize pres- ence, endlessly discussed and constantly on exhibit. Few American artists of the 20th century arrived with quite his éclat. He was in his early 20s when his large-scale black paint- ings — precisely delineated black stripes separated by thin lines of blank canvas — took the art world by storm. Austere, self-referen- tial, opaque, they cast a chilling spell. \nWriting in Art International magazine in 1960, the art historian William Rubin declared himself “almost mesmerized” by the “eerie, magical presence” of the paintings. Time only ratified the consensus. \n# \nFrank Stella, whose laconic pin- stripe “black paintings” of the late 1950s closed the door on Abstract Expressionism and pointed the way to an era of cool minimalism, died on Saturday at his home in the West Village of Manhattan. He was 87. \n# \nBy this time of year, college- bound high school seniors are usually celebrating their choices, researching dorms and even thinking of their majors. This year, that’s not necessarily the case. Because of a disastrous rollout of the new application for federal tuition aid, many still don’t know how much tuition they would be paying and so have not decided where they can afford to go. The Education Department’s redesigned form for the Free Ap- plication for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was supposed to make applying for tuition aid easier and more accessible. But faced with a bureaucratic mess caused by technical meltdowns and severe delays in processing information and receiving aid packages, stu- dents say the new system has been  anything  but  clear  or streamlined. \n“They remain some of the most unforgettable, provocative paint- ings in the recent history of Amer- ican Modernism,” the critic Karen Wilkin wrote in The New Criterion in 2007.

They wanted his take on a debate that had been gnaw- ing at them. Their friends from a local public high school had been talking  about  discrimination against Latinos. Did the pastor agree? Does the government give white people more power? “No, no, no. That’s not true. We are not in oppression. Everybody here has the same rights,” Mr. Pe- rez recalled telling the boys in a mini-sermon that hit on some of his favorite themes: freedom in the United States, scarcity and re- pression in Latin America and the dangers of what he views as liber- als’ notions of victimhood. “This is an agenda against the country,” he told them. “They are trying to put confusion in your mind, and they are trying to bully you to be against your country, against everything.” It was not the first time the pas- tor’s counsel was more worldly than spiritual. As he ministers to a growing flock of 250 families in the dusty suburbs of Las Vegas, Mr. Perez has transformed from a leader who rarely acknowledged politics to an eager foot soldier in the cultural and political battles in his adopted country.

They’re joking. Sort of. At least in most cases. It’s a gallows humor with a dark edge. As much of official Washington is bracing for the possibility that former President Donald J. Trump really could return — this time with “retribution” as his avowed mission — the discussion is where people might go into a sort of self-imposed exile. Whether they mean it or not, the buzz is a telling indicator of the grim mood among many in the nation’s capital these days. The “what if” goes beyond the normal prospect of a side unhap- py about a lost election. It speaks to the nervousness about a would-be president who talks of being a dictator for a day, who vows to “root out” enemies he called “vermin,” who threatens to prosecute adversaries, who suggests a general he deems \nFAFSA is a free, standardized application for federal aid for col- lege tuition that millions rely on.

Most children get the “Mr. Tastee,” Mr. Mathe said, which comes with coconut, vanilla, berg- amot orange and soda. It makes sense, he added, considering that he created it with his own child- hood in mind: “It reminds me of waiting for an ice cream truck.” He ultimately decided that while it still feels a little strange to serve the sophisticated beverages to children, it felt satisfying to con- \nthey can’t. Though some contain very small traces of alcohol — or at least mimic the taste of alcohol — many nonalcoholic beverages are made solely of juices and other kid-friendly ingredients. But parents and hospitality pro- fessionals  alike  are  asking whether this trend is problematic anyway — financially, ethically or for health reasons. \n# \n# \nThe first time Tom Mathe, head bartender at L’Avenue in Manhat- tan, saw a child order a mocktail, he didn’t know what to think. “There was this initial impulse of, ‘Wait, is this   $\\mathrm{OK?}{}^{\\circ}{}^{\\circ}$   he said. “I wouldn’t explicitly target children as a demographic when I make any kind of drink.” Yet he has noticed more chil- \ntribute to family dining experi- ences “in an interesting way.” As  nonalcoholic  cocktails, wines and beers have become sta- ples on bar menus across Amer- ica, some children — people way under the legal drinking age — have begun to partake.
