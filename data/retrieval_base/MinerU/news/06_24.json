No. 60,195 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nMONDAY, JUNE 24, 2024 \n# \n\nLawsuits Describe Leaders Rejecting Pleas From Employees for Safeguards \n# \nIn April 2019, David Ginsberg, a Meta executive, emailed his boss, Mark Zuckerberg, with a proposal to research and reduce loneliness and compulsive use on Instagram and Facebook. \nthe states’ court filings — includ- ing roughly 1,400 pages of com- pany documents and correspon- dence filed as evidence by the State of Tennessee — shows how Mr. Zuckerberg and other Meta leaders repeatedly promoted the safety of the company’s platforms, playing down risks to young peo- ple, even as they rejected employ- ee pleas to bolster youth guard- rails and hire additional staff. In interviews, the attorneys general of several states suing Meta said Mr. Zuckerberg had led his company to drive user engage- ment at the expense of child wel- fare. \nIn the email, Mr. Ginsberg noted that the company faced scrutiny for its products’ influence “especially around areas of prob- lematic use/addiction and teens.” He asked Mr. Zuckerberg for 24 engineers, researchers and other staff, saying Instagram had a “deficit” on such issues. \ncompany’s chief financial officer, informed Mr. Ginsberg that the project was “not funded” because of staffing constraints. \n# \n“A lot of these decisions ulti- mately landed on Mr. Zucker- berg’s desk,” said Raúl Torrez, the attorney general of New Mexico. “He needs to be asked explicitly, and held to account explicitly, for the decisions that he’s made.” \nAdam  Mosseri,  Instagram’s head, ultimately declined to fi- nance the project, too, writing in an email: “Unfortunately I don’t see us funding this from Insta- gram any time soon.” \nFrom left, Ron Klain, 62, President Biden’s former chief of staff; Ted Kaufman, 85, Mr. Biden’s longtime Senate chief of staff; and Mike Donilon, 65, a close adviser since the ’80s. The three confidants are part of an echo chamber where dissent is rare. \nThe state lawsuits against Meta reflect mounting concerns that teenagers and children on social media can be sexually solicited, harassed, bullied, body-shamed and algorithmically induced into compulsive online use. Last Mon- day, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, called for warn- ing labels to be placed on social networks, saying the platforms present a public health risk to young people. \nThe email exchanges are just one slice of evidence cited among more than a dozen lawsuits filed since last year by the attorneys general of 45 states and the Dis- trict of Columbia. The states ac- cuse Meta of unfairly ensnaring teenagers and children on Insta- gram and Facebook while deceiv- ing the public about the hazards. Using a coordinated legal ap- proach reminiscent of the govern- ment’s pursuit of Big Tobacco in the 1990s, the attorneys general seek to compel Meta to bolster protections for minors.

Trump as the presi- dential debate draws closer. When he leaves for Delaware on weekends, Mr. Biden seeks out Ted Kaufman, a confidant who represents the president’s ties to the state that introduced him to the national stage more than a half-century ago. \n# \nInterviews with dozens of peo- ple close to the president reveal a truth at the heart of Mr. Biden’s political life: While he is sur- rounded by a diverse and multi- generational crowd of campaign operatives, policy experts and cabinet secretaries, he reserves his full trust for a small circle of in- siders who are the definition of old school. \nWASHINGTON — Multiple times each day, President Biden dials up Mike Donilon, a close ad- viser since the 1980s, to chew on the latest polls and headlines. “What’s your instinct? What do you think?” Mr. Biden will ask Mr. Donilon, who recently left the White House for the campaign’s Delaware headquarters. Once a week, Mr. Biden sum- mons Ron Klain, his former chief of staff, to workshop the best at- \n# \nIn 2021, retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Donald J. Trump’s first na- tional security adviser, became chairman of a 75-year-old non- profit organization — the kind of small charity where chairmen typically work for free. But Mr. Flynn received a salary of \\$40,000, for working two hours per week. \nMr. Klain is the youngest at 62. Mr. Donilon is 65. Mr. Kaufman is 85, four years older than Mr. Bi- den. Each has earned the presi- dent’s trust over not just years but decades.

By the end of its second year, his nonprofit group, America’s Fu- ture Inc., was running in the red, burning through reserves — and still paying \\$518,000, or 29 percent of its budget, to Flynns. \nJosh Perez and Natasha Marks signed up for “Couples Therapy” after watching the show at home. \n# \nOne night after a blowout fight with his fiancée, Josh Perez was lying in bed, typing silently on his phone. \n# \nNETIVOT, Israel — The south- ern Israeli city of Netivot, a work- ing-class hub for mystical rabbis about 10 miles from the Gaza bor- der, escaped the worst of the Ha- mas-led attack of Oct. 7, a fluke many residents ascribe to miracu- lous intervention by the Jewish sages buried here. \nHe was searching for contacts for the producers behind “Couples Therapy,” a documentary series he and his fiancée began watching during the pandemic. The show, which follows real couples in the New York area as they undergo about five months of therapy, had become a conduit for having diffi- cult conversations about their own relationship. Perez hoped that being selected for the show could help them even more. Months later, Perez and his fi- ancée, Natasha Marks, sat on a couch inside a soundstage in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Green- point. Across from them, on a TV set built to look like a therapist’s office, was Orna Guralnik, the psychoanalyst and therapeutic maestro of “Couples Therapy.” \nSince leaving the Trump admin- istration under an ethical cloud, Michael Flynn has converted his Trump-world celebrity into a lu- crative and sprawling family busi- ness. He and his relatives have marketed the retired general as a martyr, raising hundreds of thou- sands of dollars for a legal-de- fense fund and then pocketing leftover money. Through a net- work of nonprofit and for-profit ventures, they have sold far-right conspiracy theories, ranging from lies about the 2020 election to warnings, embraced by followers of QAnon, about cabals of pe- dophiles and child traffickers. “This is one that goes up to the \nNevertheless, many here seem to show little concern about the suffering now of the Palestinian civilians — practically neighbors — across the fence in Gaza. Michael Zigdon, who operates a small food shack in Netivot’s run- down market and had employed two men from Gaza until the at- tack, expressed little sympathy for Gazans, who have endured a ferocious Israeli military on- slaught for the past eight months. “Who wants this war and who doesn’t?” Mr. Zigdon said, while mopping up red food dye that had spilled from a crushed-ice drink machine in his shack. “It wasn’t us who attacked them on Oct. 7.” Like many Israelis, Mr. Zigdon blamed Hamas for embedding it- self in residential areas, endan- \n“I guess if I was to sum up why we’re here,” Marks said, searching Perez’s face as she spoke, “we just recently had a little baby boy, and our emotional and physical inti- macy, for a while, has taken a tank.” \nwho appeared across the first three seasons, many said the prospect of 20 free hourlong ses- sions with a therapist whose work they could preview on television was a main draw.
