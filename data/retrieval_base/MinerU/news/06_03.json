He might not have anticipated all the par- ticulars, such as the porn actress in the hotel room and the illicit payoff to keep her quiet. But he feared that eventually a criminal might occupy the presidency and use his powers to thwart anyone who sought to hold him account- able. “Away with your president,” he declared, “we shall have a \nMr. Trump be returned to office.

But he has been put on the spot by President Biden’s announcement outlining a pro- posal for a truce. \ntional deterrents could discour- age abuses or excesses. Moreover, the judiciary may not be the check on the executive branch that it has been in the past. If no other cases go to trial before the election, it could be another four years before the courts could even consider whether the newly elected presi- dent jeopardized national securi- ty or illegally sought to overturn the 2020 election, as he has been charged with doing. As it is, even before the election, the Supreme Court may grant Mr. Trump at least some measure of immunity. Mr. Trump would still have to operate within the constitutional system, analysts point out, but he has already shown a willing- ness to push its boundaries. When he was president, he claimed that the Constitution gave him “the right to do what- ever I want.” After leaving office, he advo- cated “termination” of the Consti- tution to allow him to return to power right away without an- Continued on Page A17 \nMr. Netanyahu, a conserva- tive, has long juggled competing personal, political and national interests. He now appears to be facing a stark choice between the survival of his hard-line, hawkish government and bringing home hostages held in Gaza while setting himself and Israel on a new course away from growing international isolation. \nThat was exactly what the founders sought to avoid, having thrown off the yoke of an all- powerful monarch. But as hard as they worked to establish checks and balances, the system they constructed to hold way- ward presidents accountable has ultimately proved to be unsteady. Whatever rules Americans thought were in place are now being rewritten by Donald J. Trump, the once and perhaps future president who has already shattered many barriers and precedents. The notion that 34 felonies is not automatically disqualifying and a convicted criminal can be a viable candi- date for commander in chief upends two and a half centuries of assumptions about American democracy. And it raises fundamental questions about the limits of \nCritics of the prime minister have portrayed him as indecisive and say there are two Netanya- hus. One, they say, functions pragmatically in the small war cabinet he formed with some centrist rivals, to give it public legitimacy. The other is effec- tively being held hostage by the far-right members of his govern- ing coalition, who oppose any concession to Hamas and who ensure his political survival. \nThe state, spurred by climate change, has made it harder to expand highways, and transportation officials are turning eyes and money to public transit.

That leaves 31 mem- bers — 19 Republicans and 12 Democrats, 20 of whom were in- terviewed for this article — who have decided to leave the House of their own volition, with no elector- al pressure to do so. \nabout one-eighth of the total body, will not be seeking another term this November. \n# \n“I distinctly recall crawling on yet another plane to come back for yet another vote that made abso- lutely no difference and was going absolutely nowhere,” he said in an interview. “And I had this singular experience of asking myself, ‘Why would you do this?’” Mr. Blumenauer’s moment of truth was in fact far from singular.

The ruling undermined a central element of his public identity as a brilliant business- man. \nHis felony conviction on Thurs- day, delivered by a jury of 12 Man- hattan residents, brought with it the possibility that he could even- tually be imprisoned in New York, a far cry from the image he spent decades cultivating as a real es- tate mogul and man about town.

Trump’s felony conviction in New York. \nBut a plea deal, which offered him some immunity from pros- ecution and did not include prison time, imploded in July. The judge in the case punched holes in the agreement, to the delight of Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress who tried to scuttle that deal and have portrayed Hunter Biden’s legal problems as equivalent to those of their party’s 2024 presidential candidate in an effort to impeach President Biden. \n“There is a prejudice that, first, Germans don’t have any sense of humor, and second, they do not have fun, and third, their language sounds very aggressive,” said Bodo Wartke, the rap’s lyricist who, along with Marti Fischer, the composer, created the viral “Bar- bara’s Rhubarb Bar” tune.
