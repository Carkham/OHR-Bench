No. 60,236 \n© 2024  The New York Times Company \n# \n# \n\n# \nPower Vacuum in War Fuels Lawlessness \nOld Tactic Tries to Sow  Suspicion About Harris \n# \nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza — As he perused a market selling ev- erything from stolen children’s shoes to battered plumbing pipes, Mahmoud al-Jabri was surprised to find something familiar: his own book collection. \n# \nWhen former President Don- ald J. Trump challenged Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity at a public forum on Wednesday — and again on social media the next day — that was the message at the core of his remarks. \nAmong the collection was his first published work of poems, with his handwriting scrawled along the margins. Even more shocking than seeing the book he had toiled for years to create was that the vendor wanted a paltry 5 shekels, or about \\$1, for it. \nIt is a tactic that has long been part of the underside of Ameri- can politics: presenting an oppo- nent as somehow “other” or “not one of us” — someone who can- not be trusted or truly known. But while this has been a re- current theme in American cam- paigns for at least a century, Mr. Trump has taken it to a new level, historians and analysts said. What has often been a subtext or a whisper campaign driven by surrogates is, in Mr. Trump’s hands, a central mes- sage of his campaign — project- ed on screens at a rally, pro- moted on social media and re- inforced by his running mate. Mr. Trump has personally led the effort, explicitly falsifying the biography of his opponent and invoking race and gender in ways no modern major-party leader has done before. Even as a noncandidate in the 2008 elec- tion, he deployed such tactics against Barack Obama, demand- ing to see Mr. Obama’s birth certificate and claiming that Mr. Obama — who went on to be the nation’s first Black president and was born in Hawaii — was not born in this country. “Whenever the United States is poised to break a political glass ceiling, we see an intensification of othering in our politics,” said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at the School of Inter- national and Public Affairs at Columbia University. “What makes Trump a singularly poi- sonous political player is that the top of the ticket is overtly engag- ing in othering against his politi- cal opponent.” \nThe salesman suggested using the pages for kindling. \n“I was torn between two feel- ings,” he said, “laughter and bit- terness.” \nIn Gaza, even poetry books can become a source of profit for en- terprising thieves. A pervasive lawlessness has emerged from the rubble of cities obliterated since Israel launched its all-out offen- sive on the enclave in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7. “Thieves’ markets,” as they are called by locals, have proliferated across Gaza, selling loot plun- dered from homes, businesses and even hospitals. With Israel blocking the flow of most goods into Gaza, the markets have be- come important places for finding household necessities. And visits to the markets have become a weary ritual for Gazans seeking to reclaim stolen pieces of their lives. Some, like Mr. Al-Jabri, even \nSome experts say a solar geoengineering intervention to slow rising temperatures could lead to unpredictable calamities. \n# \n\n# \nsphere, it would be possible to lower tem- peratures worldwide, blunting global warming. \n# \nCHICAGO — David Keith was a gradu- ate student in 1991 when a volcano erupted in the Philippines, sending a cloud of ash toward the edge of space. Seventeen million tons of sulfur dioxide \nSuch radical interventions are increas- ingly being taken seriously as the effects of climate change grow more intense. Global temperatures have hit record highs for 13 months in a row, unleashing violent weather, deadly heat waves and raising sea levels. Scientists expect the heat to keep climbing for decades. The main driver of the warming, the burning of fos- sil fuels, continues more or less unabated. Against this backdrop, there is growing interest in efforts to intentionally alter the Earth’s climate, a field known as geoengi- neering. \nIn his hometown in southern Gaza, Khan Younis, where the central market was reduced to rubble by Israeli strikes, vendors sell stolen hospital supplies and clothes on plastic tarps or wooden carts alongside produce sellers on the main road out of the battered city. \n# \nAltering the Stratosphere \nreleased from Mount Pinatubo spread across the stratosphere, reflecting some of the sun’s energy away from Earth.

When in March Mr. Donaldson and Amazon MGM studios an- nounced “Beast Games,” a  reality  competition show in the mold of Mr- Beast’s popular videos, thousands  of  people jumped at the chance, posting  on  Reddit threads about the appli- cation process and wait- ing hopefully to be ac- cepted. \nJimmy Donaldson is the inter- net’s fairy godmother. Better known online as Mr- Beast, Mr. Donaldson, 26, has made a name for himself as a be- nevolent YouTube star who has racked up hundreds of millions of subscribers for his pro- vocative brand of philan- thropy, like the time he paid for 1,000 people to receive cataract surgery. The  resulting  eight- minute video was hyper- bolically  titled   $\\bar{\\mathrm{~\\bar{1}}\\mathrm{{,}}000}$  Blind People See for the First Time.” \nMs. Bairachna met a soldier, but then he was sent to the front. She traded text messages with an- other man, but those fizzled out because he was in no mood to meet, fearing he might soon be drafted. On the dating app Bum- ble, Ms. Bairachna liked the looks of a hipster. But when she scrolled through his photographs, she no- ticed his amputated leg. “I looked at his profile for 15 minutes and felt so sorry for him,” Ms. Bairachna, 35, a marketing di- rector for a clothing brand in Kyiv, said in an interview. She won- dered if she could handle a rela- tionship with a maimed war vet- eran. Then she swiped left, remov- ing him from potential matches. “I feel I’m not ready for that.” Russia’s full-scale invasion has upended nearly every facet of daily life in Ukraine.

While the pur- suit of love might seem secondary to dealing with missile attacks, power outages and food short- ages, many Ukrainians say they need romantic relationships to help them cope with the trauma of living in a nation at war. For women, the problem is par- ticularly acute. Tens of thousands of men have died. Many more are on the front lines, some have fled the country and others are reluc- tant to leave their homes, fearful of being stopped in the street by draft officers. In cities like Kyiv, the capital, the presence of men has noticeably dwindled. In some villages, conscription has hol- lowed out the male population. “This leaves a small percentage Continued on Page 12 \n\nThe YouTube star MrBeast. \nhave become his calling card.
