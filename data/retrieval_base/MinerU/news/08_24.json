Levien  and  Jona- than Swan . \nCHICAGO — Joy cometh in the morning, but so do hang- overs. The party in Chicago is done, the confetti has been swept up, the pictures have been posted to social media. But the real question as exuberant Dem- ocrats woke up on Friday was whether they could channel the sheer intoxication of United Center into a sustained, 74-day sprint to Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris emerged from her nominating convention with a burst of mo- mentum that Democrats hardly expected barely a month ago, when they thought they would be tethered to a possibly doomed re-election bid by President Biden. She has rejuvenated a once demoralized party and given a jolt of optimism to Demo- crats who now see victory in \nMichelle Obama, made a point of warning ecstatic Democrats this week to temper their heady expectations. Ms. Harris has had one of the most impressive de- buts of any general election candidate in recent times, yet she still faces polls within the margin of error. \nRobert F . Kennedy Jr. threw his support behind former President Donald J. Trump on Friday after suspending his troubled inde- pendent campaign for president, saying he was withdrawing his name from the ballot in battle- ground states and that Mr. Trump had “asked to enlist me” in his sec- ond administration. \n“The energy here is electric,” Representative Hillary Scholten, Democrat of Michigan, said minutes before Ms. Harris’s acceptance speech on Thursday night. “But I wouldn’t be doing my job if I said I was now feeling confident in Michigan. We’re still the underdog, and it’s going to take some true Michigan grit to turn this energy into action and secure a Michigan win.” \nHe announced his plans in a speech in Phoenix that also casti- gated the mainstream media and accused the Democratic Party of “abandoning democracy” and en- gaging in “legal warfare” against him and Mr. Trump. \nCampaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump expressed delight with Mr. Kennedy’s decision. “That’s big,” he said. “He’s a great guy, re- spected by everybody.” Mr. Trump was scheduled to appear at an Ari- zona rally later Friday, and his campaign had told supporters to expect a “special guest.” \nMs. Scholten knows of what she speaks. She captured a Re- publican seat in 2022 that had not gone for a Democrat in 32 years. She understands what it takes to win in a closely divided battleground state that may be critical to victory for Ms. Harris. And she remembers when Mr. Trump surprised the world by overcoming Hillary Clinton eight years ago. \nThe buzzkill reality, however, is that victory is anything but as- sured. The thousands of jubilant delegates in the hall this week were not representative of the swing voters that Ms. Harris needs to defeat former President Donald J. Trump. History is littered with presidential candi- dates who roused their partisans at conventions only to fall short come November. And whatever else he is, Mr. Trump is no push- over. Ms. Harris can expect a bruising battle over the next two and a half months. She knows that, of course, and veterans of past campaigns, including former President Bill \nMr. Kennedy’s decision to back Mr. Trump, in the final months be- fore a closely fought general elec- tion, was a remarkable twist for the scion of a Democratic political dynasty. A longtime Democrat, Mr. Kennedy renounced his party, whose leaders in turn accused him of running as a stalking horse for Mr. Trump. \n“Getting comfortable is what happened in 2016, when we lost Michigan to Trump by less than 10,000 votes,” Ms. Scholten said. “Trump is coming to Michigan again on Monday. He’s clearly not giving up on Michigan. We can’t either.” \nIn his remarks, Mr. Kennedy, 70, said he had pledged to leave the race if he “became a spoiler” — a candidate with no path to victory who could nonetheless alter the  \nBut Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, another swing state, said she thought the  Continued on Page A14 \n# \n# \nwell-connected financier; John W.

In speeches to world leaders, interviews with foreign journal- ists and documentaries on Net- flix, Pepe Mujica, as he is univer- sally known, shared countless tales from a life story fit for film.

He became one of Latin America’s most influential and important figures in large part for his plain- spoken philosophy on the path to a better society and happier life.
