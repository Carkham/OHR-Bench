Many places have no running wa- ter, flushing toilets or garbage pickup. \nWASHINGTON  —  Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday eas- ily batted down an attempt by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to oust him from his post, after Democrats linked arms with most Republi- cans to fend off a second attempt by G.O.P . hard-liners to strip the gavel from their party leader. \n“There are kids at my camp who have no parents,” said Agenithe Jean, 39, who left her home in the Carrefour-Feuilles neighborhood of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, in August for an improvised camp in an empty lot about six miles away. “We need la- trines. We need somewhere to go.” At least 360,000 people — more than half of them in the capital or surrounding neighborhoods — have fled their homes in Haiti over the past year, and that number of internally displaced people is ex- pected in the coming months to surpass 400,000, according to the U.N.’s International Office for Mi- gration. \nThe vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43, with sev- en voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue, with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him. \nMembers of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker, and when the last Republican to hold the post, Kevin McCarthy, faced a removal vote last fall, Democrats voted en masse to allow the mo- tion to move forward and then to jettison him, helping lead to his historic ouster. \n# \n# \n# \nsaid. “The true antidote to igno- rance and bias is to teach.” The hearing came about five months after a hearing on anti- semitism in which the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania gave lawyerly statements, prompting an intense backlash that helped lead to their resignations. \n# \nThis article is by  Dana Goldstein , Troy Closson  and  Michael Levenson . WASHINGTON — A Republi- can-led House committee turned its attention to three of the most politically liberal school districts in the country on Wednesday, ac- cusing them of tolerating anti- semitism, but the district leaders pushed back forcefully, defending their schools. \nThis time, the Democratic sup- port made the critical difference, allowing Mr. Johnson, who has a minuscule majority, to avoid a re- moval vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P . speaker, 11 Republicans ul- timately voted to allow her motion to move forward. \nHundreds are unaccompanied children, including orphans and others separated from their par- ents in the chaos. \n# \nBiden Curtails Bombs  Despite ‘Ironclad’ Bond \nAs hurricane season nears, hu- manitarian groups and Haiti’s dis- aster response office are racing to figure out how to address the swelling crowds living in impro- vised shelters in a capital overrun by gangs with a barely function- ing national government. \nEnikia Ford Morthel, the super- intendent of Berkeley schools, ac- knowledged some incidents in her schools but pointedly stated that “antisemitism is not pervasive in Berkeley Unified School District.” David C. Banks, the New York City schools chancellor, said the repeatedly hostile questions from the panel suggested it was trying to elicit “gotcha moments” rather than solve the problem of anti- semitism. \n# \nWASHINGTON — The mes- sage was not getting through. Not through the phone calls or the emissaries or the public statements or the joint commit- tee meetings. And so, frustrated that he was being ignored, Presi- dent Biden chose a more dra- matic way of making himself clear to Israeli leaders. He stopped sending the bombs. \nThat was the same number of Republicans who voted in October to allow the bid to remove Mr. Mc- Carthy to advance — but back then, they were joined by every Democrat. \nlarly damaging moments. Nor did the school leaders’ an- swers appear to prompt wide- spread anger back in their com- munities, as happened when Ne- mat Shafik, the president of Co- lumbia, testified before Congress last month. Her promise to crack down on protesters seemed to mollify Republicans, at least tem- porarily, but deepened discontent  \nThe hearing was the third by House Republicans to expose what they see as a pro-Palestinian agenda gripping schools and col- lege campuses since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. During the contentious two- hour session, Republicans ac- cused the district leaders — from New York City; Berkeley, Calif.; and Montgomery County, Md. — of “turning a blind eye” to anti- \n“I appreciate the show of confi- dence from my colleagues to de- feat this misguided effort,” Mr. Johnson told reporters shortly af- ter Wednesday’s vote. “As I’ve  \n“We cannot simply discipline our way out of this problem,” he \nMr. Biden’s decision to pause the delivery of 3,500 bombs to Israel was meant to convey a powerful signal that his patience has limits. While insisting that his support for the Jewish state remains “ironclad,” Mr. Biden for the first time since the Gaza war erupted last fall opted to use his power as Israel’s chief arms supplier to demonstrate his discontent. \nA United Nations drive to raise \\$674 million to address the grow- ing list of basic needs in Haiti has collected just 16 percent of the goal. The United States provided \\$69.5 million of the \\$107 million raised so far. \nContinued on Page A15 \n“We cannot simply discipline our way out of this problem,” Chancellor David C. Banks said. \n\nThe competition for attention and resources can be eclipsed by crises around the world, including in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, aid groups said. The response has paled in comparison to the mas- sive international effort following Haiti’s cataclysmic 2010 earth- quake, when countries and aid or- ganizations sent billions in aid. \nThe hold on the bombs repre- sents a significant turning point in the 76-year-old relationship between the United States and Israel, historically one of the closest security partnerships in the world. But it may not neces- sarily be a breaking point. The Biden administration is still allowing most other weapons to be sent to Israel, and in fact officials emphasized that no final decision has even been made on the bombs that are currently in limbo. \nSpeaker Mike Johnson easily defeated a “misguided effort.” \n# \nMr. Biden hopes the selective pause will prompt Prime Min- ister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to forgo a long-threatened  \n# \nMariano Torres, a maintenance worker at Columbia University, was cleaning on the third floor of Hamilton Hall in his signature Yankees cap one night last week when he heard a commotion downstairs. He said he figured it had something to do with the pro- Palestinian encampment on the lawn outside and kept working. He was shocked, he said, when he suddenly saw five or six pro- testers, their faces covered by scarves or masks, picking up chairs and bringing them into the stairway. \n“this is bigger than you.” One per- son, he recalled, told him he didn’t get paid enough to deal with this. Someone tried to offer him “a fist- ful of cash.” \nContinued on Page A9 \n# \nHe said he replied: “I don’t want your money, dude. Just get out of the building.” \nIt was the beginning of what would be a frightening time for Mr. Torres and two other mainte- nance workers in Hamilton Hall, who were inside when pro-Pales- tinian protesters at Columbia took over the building. \nbecoming illegal in Florida, where the legislature has joined a grow- ing number of states to ban the in- tentional release of balloons out- doors. The Florida ban is expected to be signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and would take effect July 1.

Continued on Page A20 \nBalloons released in the sky don’t go to heaven. They often end up in oceans and waterways, where they’re 32 times more likely to kill seabirds than other types of plastic debris. Despite this, hu- mans like to release them en masse, be it to celebrate a loved one’s life or a wedding, or to reveal the gender of a baby. The practice is on the verge of \nweeks. But the balloon ban is rare for garnering widespread biparti- san support.
