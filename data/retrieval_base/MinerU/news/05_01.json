Bromwich ,  Alan Feuer  and William K. Rashbaum . \nHe was the man behind the hush money, the amiable Beverly Hills lawyer who specialized in ce- lebrity dirt — unearthing it, and then, for the right price, burying it forever. \nAfter seven months of an Israel- Hamas war in Gaza, the United States, Qatar and several other countries have been hoping to broker a cease-fire, and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is vis- iting the Middle East to press for an agreement. \nBut with Hamas arguing that any agreement should include an end to the war, and with right- wing politicians in Israel threat- ening to leave the government co- alition if the long-planned incur- sion into the southern Gazan city of Rafah is delayed, Mr. Netanya- hu said that Israel reserved the right to keep fighting. \nelection:  Their  names  were Stormy Daniels and Karen Mc- Dougal, and they were ready to tell the world about their sexual encounters with Donald J. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Davidson took the witness stand at Mr. Trump’s criminal  trial  in  Manhattan, telling jurors the behind-the- scenes story of how Mr. Trump’s allies bought his clients’ silence. His hours of testimony opened a rare window on the seamy world of celebrity hush money and cor- roborated key facts underpinning the prosecution’s case against Mr. Trump, the first American presi- dent to face a criminal trial. \n# \n# \n“The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question,” he said in a meeting with the families of hostages being held in Gaza, ac- cording to a statement from his of- fice. “We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battal- ions there — with or without a deal — in order to achieve the total vic- tory.” \nfeel tense, one of the students started to record the encounter. They are not sure precisely how the protest leader determined they were supportive of Israel. “Suddenly we are being called ‘the Zionists’ in their encamp- ment,” Mr. Weinberg said. “He put a target on our back.” \n# \n# \nIn a video shared widely online, a leader of the pro-Palestinian stu- dent movement at Columbia Uni- versity stands near the center of a lawn on the campus and calls out, “We have Zionists who have en- tered the camp.” \n# \nWASHINGTON — When students took over Hamilton Hall at Columbia University in April 1968, a young Joe Biden was studying law 250 miles away, just weeks from gradu- \nThe protesters link arms and march in formation toward three Jewish students who have come inside the encampment. “It was really scary because we had like 75 people quickly gath- ered around, encircling us, doing exactly what he said to do,” Avi Weinberg, one of the Jewish stu- dents, said in an interview. He and his friends had gone to see the en- campment, not intending to pro- voke, he said. When it began to \nIn a crucial back-and-forth with prosecutors, Mr. Davidson began to tie Mr. Trump to the \\$130,000 hush-money payment to Ms. Dan- iels, the porn star whose payoff is at the heart of the case. Although Mr. Trump did not pay Ms. Daniels directly — his fixer, Michael D. Co- hen did — Mr. Davidson portrayed Mr. Trump as the hidden hand shaping the machinations. \nMr.  Netanyahu’s  comments came a day before he was to meet with Mr. Blinken, who, along with other Biden administration offi- cials, has been pressing Israel to avoid a major assault on Rafah in order to minimize civilian casu- alties. The war has already killed more than   $_{34,000}$   Palestinians, Gazan health officials say. \nOn Thursday, the incident took on new significance when a video from January resurfaced on social media showing the same protest leader, Khymani James, saying “Zionists don’t deserve to live” and “Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zion- ists.” \nDozens of protesters, who have created a tent village called the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment,” repeat his words back to him: “We have Zionists who have entered the camp.” \nNEWS ation.

In recent months, money has flowed into the United States with a force that’s being felt by policymakers, politicians and peo- ple from Brussels to Beijing, To- ronto to Tokyo. \n# \nThe dollar index, a common way to gauge the general strength of the U.S. currency against a bas- ket of its major trading partners, is hovering at levels last seen in the early 2000s (when U.S. inter- est rates were also similarly high). \nTwo-thirds of the roughly 150 currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar, whose recent strength stems from a shift in expectations about when and by how much the Federal Re- serve may cut its benchmark in- terest rate, which sits around a 20- year high. \nThe deal is also a case study in modern-day conservation.
