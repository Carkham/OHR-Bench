It was the first official economic policy proposal of her presiden- tial campaign, and it was pitched as a direct response to the high price of putting food on the table in America today. \n# \nThis  month,  F.B.I.  agents searched the homes of two promi- nent figures with connections to Russian state media: Scott Ritter, a former United Nations weapons inspector and critic of American foreign policy, and Dimitri K. Simes, an adviser to former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump’s first presi- dential campaign in 2016. Pros- ecutors  have  not  announced charges against either of the men. More searches are expected soon, some of the officials said, speaking on the condition of ano- nymity to discuss investigations. Criminal charges are also possi- ble, they said. \nAn Identity Forged on the Nebraska Prairie \nVP Harris to call for first-ever federal ban on corporate price- gouging,” the Harris campaign proclaimed in the subject line of a news release last week, ahead of a speech laying out the first planks of her economic agenda. It is still impossible to say, from publicly available details, what exactly the ban would do. Republicans have denounced the proposal as “communist,” warn- ing that it would lead to the federal government setting prices in the marketplace. For- mer President Donald J. Trump has mocked the plan on social media as “SOVIET Style Price Controls.” \nBy MATT FLEGENHEIMER VALENTINE, Neb. — Tim Walz was 14 or so, trouble-seeking with his cousins across a shaggy patch of family land where they liked to shoot air guns at birds.

But people familiar with Ms. Harris’s thinking on the ban now say it might not resemble either of those characterizations. The ban, they also suggest, might actually not do anything to bring down grocery prices right now. Those who spoke about the strat- egy behind the emerging policy did so on the condition of ano- nymity. \n“Dad specifically —  specifically — said, ‘Now don’t shoot them windows,’”  one  cousin,  Matt Reiman, said of the car recently. What happened next was prob- ably inevitable: Pop. Shatter. Gleeful profanity from Mr. Walz — and a knee-jerk confession with no adults around. \nThose efforts include Novem- ber’s contest between Mr. Trump and Vice President Kamala Har- ris. For a third time, according to the officials and public state- ments, the Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus has thrown itself be- hind Mr. Trump’s candidacy, cre- ating online news outlets and fake videos to denigrate President Bi- den and, more recently, Ms. Har- ris. \n“My gun went off!”  he shouted, as if it might have been an acci- dent, formulating his pre-emptive defense in real time. “ My gun went off!” \ncused on potential violations of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and a law that requires the disclosure of lobbying efforts on behalf of foreign governments. The government’s investigation is politically fraught, reprising the furiously partisan debate over Russia’s influence in the 2016 presidential campaign. By target- ing Americans working with news organizations, even if they are state-run, the inquiry could also bump up against the First Amend- ment’s protection of rights to free speech. \nRelatives said Mr. Walz would later deny culpability of any sort. “He could make something un- believable  believable,”  Casey Reiman, another cousin who was there, said fondly, if still a bit grudgingly, some 45 years later. “Had a lot of giggle in him,” Matt Reiman said. “Never had a seri- ous day in his life.” \nMs. Harris’s campaign has created the space for multiple interpretations, by declining to specify how that ban would work, when it would apply or what behaviors it would prohibit. In the process, the vice presi- dent and her team are discover- ing the double-edged reality of releasing a policy proposal that is thin on detail: Anyone is free to imagine what those details might be. \nTop left, Tim Walz in high school.

Vice President Kamala Harris is trying something different: deflating him.
