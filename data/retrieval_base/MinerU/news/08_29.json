The goal, as de- scribed by three Iranian officials, has been to foment unrest against Israel by flooding the West Bank with as many weapons as it can, The New York Times reported in April. \n# \nJERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israeli troops backed by drones and armored vehicles carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, Israeli and Palestinian officials said on Wednesday, a growing third front in conflicts that extend from the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip to southern Lebanon. At least 10 Palestinians were killed, the Palestinian Health Min- istry said, in what Israeli officials described as an ongoing operation targeting militants and concen- trated in Jenin and Tulkarm, two West Bank cities that an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Na- dav Shoshani, said have become militant strongholds. The Israeli military said it had killed nine mil- itants. \nIsraeli ground troops this week have been pushing into Khan You- nis in southern Gaza, and the Gazan health authorities said on Wednesday that Israeli strikes had killed 58 Palestinians in the enclave over the past day. \nThe military said on Wednes- day that it had recovered the body of a soldier kidnapped on Oct. 7. It was not clear from the military’s statement whether the soldier had been taken to Gaza dead or still alive; it said it was withhold- ing his name at the request of his family. \nA Palestinian armed group based in Jenin said it had fired on Israeli forces in two villages on the city’s outskirts, and Palestinian residents in both cities described hearing intermittent gunfire. The operation followed months of escalating Israeli raids in the occupied territory, where nearly three million Palestinians live un- der Israeli military rule. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel, according to the United Nations, in violence involving both the Is- raeli military and extremist Jew- ish settlers. Israel has also ar- rested thousands of Palestinians suspected  of  involvement  in armed groups. \nA day earlier, Israeli troops res- cued the hostage Farhan al-Qadi, whom they had found alone in a warren of tunnels they were in- vestigating in the enclave. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, at least 30 of whom are presumed dead by the Israeli authorities. The United Nations said on Wednesday that one of its vehicles in Gaza had been targeted by Is- raeli gunfire.

Mr. Durov, 39, was detained by the French authorities on Satur- day after a flight from Azerbaijan. He was charged on Wednesday with complicity in managing an online platform to enable illegal transactions by an organized group, which could lead to a sen- tence of up to 10 years in prison. He was also charged with com- plicity in crimes such as enabling the distribution of child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking and fraud, and refusing to cooper- ate with law enforcement. \nLaure Beccuau, the Paris pros- ecutor, said in a statement that Mr. Durov had been ordered to pay bail of 5 million euros, or about \\$5.5 million. He was released from custody but must check in at a po- lice station twice a week. Telegram has played a role in multiple criminal cases in France tied to child sexual abuse, drug trafficking and online hate crimes, but has shown a “near-total ab- sence” of response to requests for cooperation from law enforce- ment, Ms. Beccuau said. Prosecutors around France, as well as legal authorities in Bel- gium and other European coun- tries, “have shared the same ob- servation,” she said, leading orga- nized-crime prosecutors to open an investigation in February on the “potential criminal liability of executives at this messaging plat- form.” \n# \n# \nAn Encore in Paris France’s torchbearers at the opening ceremony of the Paralympics on Wednesday.
