Trump. Ms. York-Singleton, who runs a nonprofit outside Detroit, grew up in a Democratic household but considers herself more of a politi- cal independent. And while she finds Vice President Kamala Har- ris’s sudden entry in the presiden- tial race refreshing, Ms. Harris has not closed the sale for her. “I need more information from her,” said Ms. York-Singleton, 68. She listed the costs of medication and child care as well as home- lessness as problems she wants to hear Ms. Harris discuss. “People are working two to four jobs just to afford rent,” she added. \nThis article is by  Katie Rogers ,  Er- ica L.

Her former aides have returned to write a convention speech and see her through a debate against Donald J. Trump. Her sister flew to Wash- ington, joining her as she made a pork roast and marinated over her choices for a running mate. \nAs Vice President Kamala Har- ris races through the final weeks of her campaign — the only weeks, really — she is relying on a network of confidants to guide her through the hurdles ahead. \nThere is no doubt that Ms. Har- ris has lit a fire inside the Demo- cratic Party. She is drawing tens of thousands of fans to her rallies and raising hundreds of millions of dollars. A poll released last week by the Pew Research Center found that Ms. Harris has erased the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans: 62 percent of Harris voters now say they strongly support her, com- pared with 43 percent of Biden voters who expressed strong sup- port for him in July. Among for- mer President Trump’s support- ers, 64 percent characterized their backing for him as strong. \nThis group looks nothing like President Biden’s tightly held brain trust, a group that was domi- nated by older white men and family members and grew small- er as he approached the decision to end his campaign. Ms. Harris, by contrast, relies on a multi- racial, intergenerational web of about two dozen advisers, friends and relatives, firing up her phone every day to call in favors or ask for advice. \n# \n# \nair and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic. \n# \n# \nGORNJE NEDELJICE, Serbia — Their windows broken and roofs smashed, the abandoned homes in an otherwise bucolic val- ley carpeted with cornfields and orchards near Serbia’s border with Bosnia look like the wreck- age of the Balkan wars of the 1990s. \nEurope has plenty of lithium and more than 20 mining projects for the mineral at various stages of development. But none have started producing battery-grade lithium. The giant project in Ser- bia was aimed at filling that hole. “There is no green transition in Europe without this lithium,” said Chad Blewitt, the head of Rio Tin- to’s Serbian operations, adding that the company planned to in- vest more than \\$2.55 billion in the project. \n# \n“None of us knew that this mo- ment would come,” said Senator Laphonza Butler, a Democrat from California and one of several Golden State allies of Ms. Harris. But, she added, “when the oppor- tunity presented itself, of course, we were ready to do whatever was asked of us.” \nJeison Gabriel España left home on July 28 to vote for the first — and last — time in his brief life. \nBut even to many voters who lean  toward  the  Democratic ticket, the vice president remains largely undefined. And they are not as enamored with her as those flocking to see her speak. “She’s famous, but she’s un- known,” said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic strategist and poll- \nhemoth Rio Tinto, which planned to tear them down and start min- ing and processing lithium, a cru- cial element for electric car batter- ies. Its plans stalled by vociferous opposition, the company left the properties to crumble. The project has been supported by the United States and the Euro- pean Union, which is in desperate need of lithium to meet its climate goals. But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia, where fears that the mine will poison the \nA day after casting his ballot in a presidential election that had united millions of Venezuelans in a call for change, Mr. España, 18, was shot and killed in the streets. The  country’s  authoritarian leader,  Nicolás  Maduro,  had claimed victory despite over- whelming evidence that the oppo- sition candidate had won. Then he sent security forces to crush dis- sent. \nBut the houses are actually the casualties of a current struggle freighted with geopolitics: where and how Europe can get the ma- terials it needs to make electric car batteries and break its de- pendence on sources like China. The houses, in the Jadar Valley in the west of Serbia, were bought up years ago by the minerals be- \nWhile Ms. Harris has her own inner circle, she was also thrust into a campaign with only a few weeks to make her case to the American people. So she has ac- cepted the help and support of much of Mr. Biden’s team, added a few Obama-era operatives and el- evated some loyalists of her own to positions of power. \nThe Serbian government gave preliminary approval in 2019, but, worried about losing votes during protests against Rio Tinto before a Continued on Page A9 \nMs. Harris will have an oppor- tunity to introduce herself to the many Americans at the Demo- cratic National Convention, which starts on Monday.

What- ever small spaces still existed for resistance in the country are van- ishing by the day, if not the hour, as an angry Mr. Maduro pummels an electorate that tried to vote him out. \n\nBut the reality of a newly crowded campaign speeding to- ward November on a crunched timeline has led to tensions among staff members who feel there are now even more channels Continued on Page A14 \n# \nAmani Lewis’s career turn into the worst time of the artist’s life?

Two other works had recently tripled expectations, and a collector offered \\$150,000 in cash for new pieces fresh from the studio. There were shows in Paris and Miami — Lewis had seem- ingly conquered the market at age 26, upgrading to a new art studio and a Tesla. \nFor years, many Venezuelan families splintered by migration believed that they would eventu- ally unite in an improved, if per- haps not wholly democratic, Ven- ezuela. Following the election, many are burying that dream. \n# \n“I will never return to Venezue- la,” said one young woman, a data scientist living in Chile, asking that her name not be published be- cause her mother and other rela- tives remain in her home country. “Venezuela has become my worst nightmare.” \nGov.

JB Pritzker of Illinois, burst into the governor’s office with a Politico article saying Chi- cago was being courted. \nBut when the original painting re-emerged at auction in June and its price plunged to \\$10,080 — los- ing 90 percent of its value — the party was over.

The Ghanaian artist Emmanuel Taku had a painting sell in 2021 for \\$189,000 only to watch its price drop in March to \\$10,160 at auc- tion. Cubist-style portraits by Is- shaq Ismail, which sold for as much as \\$367,000 two years ago, have failed to rise beyond \\$20,000.
