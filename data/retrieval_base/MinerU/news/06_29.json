The changes that CNN insti- tuted staved off the shouting matches and the competitive cheering that have marked past debates. But they could not pre- vent Mr. Biden from starting his rushed opening remarks in a papery rasp that, before the debate was over, his campaign was stressing to reporters was the result of a cold. It did not keep him from getting lost in the corn maze of his sentences, answer after answer. \nIt could also have an effect on part of the federal case against former  President  Donald  J. Trump accusing him of plotting to overturn his 2020 loss at the polls. But the precise impact on those cases will not become clear until trial courts review them in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling. \nBut with Mr. Biden’s debate per- formance on Thursday — uneven and at times incoherent, halting even on politically advantageous subjects like abortion rights — that conversation has exploded into the public domain. \n“Biden did not rise to the occa- sion and is going to cause a seri- ous reassessment among his party: Are they going to say, Is he just having a bad night, or is he prepared to go forward?” the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader who has had a warm relationship with Mr. Biden for years, said in an interview hours after the debate. Asked for his own assessment, Mr. Sharpton replied that he hoped that it had been merely a “bad night.” \nProsecutors had argued that the law applied to efforts to ob- struct an “official proceeding” — the joint session of Congress that took place on Jan. 6, 2021, to cer- tify the Electoral College results. But Chief Justice John G. Rob- erts Jr., writing for the majority, read the law narrowly, saying it applied only when the defendant’s actions impaired the integrity of physical evidence. \nAnd it did not keep him from finishing an argument on tax reform and health care with a spiral that was surely saved instantly to the hard drives of Republican campaign opera- tives: “Making sure that we’re able to make every single soli- tary person eligible for what I’ve \nbeen able to do with, the, uh, with the Covid, excuse me, with, um, dealing with, everything we had to do with, uh . . . look . . . if — we finally beat Medicare.” There was no interruption. Mr. Biden came across loud and unclear. \nOn Capitol Hill, some Demo- cratic lawmakers openly acknowl- edged that Mr. Biden’s perform- ance was a disaster, while other leaders offered only terse signs of  Continued on Page A14 \nThe vote was 6 to 3, but it fea- tured unusual alliances. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal, voted with the majority and filed a concurring opinion. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, wrote the dissent. \n# \nYou can at least credit Mr. Biden for one accomplishment: For perhaps the first time since Mr. Trump announced for presi- dent nine years ago, he managed to hold a debate in which Mr. Trump’s performance was not the biggest news afterward. The former president and challenger had his own issues. He blustered, dodged, made false statements and repeated his denials of his 2020 election loss. He cited his golf game as proof of his acuity and uttered the line, “I didn’t have sex with a porn star.” \n# \n# \nNone of the opinions in the case discussed the charges against Mr. Trump, which rely only in part on the obstruction law. \n# \n\n# \nThe vote was 6 to 3, dividing along ideological lines. “Chevron is overruled,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. “Courts must ex- ercise their independent judg- ment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statu- tory authority.” \nWASHINGTON — The Su- preme Court on Friday reduced the power of executive agencies by sweeping aside a longstanding legal  precedent,  endangering countless regulations and trans- ferring power from the executive branch to Congress and the courts. \n# \nJustice Jackson said the Jan. 6 attack was an assault on democra- cy.

In recent days, U.S. officials have pressed their Israeli coun- terparts and passed messages to Hezbollah’s leaders with the goal of averting a wider regional con- flict that they fear could draw in both Iran and the United States. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, met with several Biden administration officials in Wash- ington this week, in large measure to discuss the escalating tensions along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. That visit followed one last week by Israel’s national \nsecurity adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, and its minister of strategic af- \nfairs, Ron Dermer. Also last week, a senior White House official, Amos Hochstein, who has assumed an informal dip- lomatic role mediating between the two sides, visited Israel and Lebanon. Mr. Hochstein warned Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran, that the United States would not be able to restrain Israel should it commit to an all-out war with the militia group. Archrivals for decades, Israel and Hezbollah have frequently ex- changed fire along Israel’s north- ern border.
