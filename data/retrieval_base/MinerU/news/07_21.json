No. 60,222 © 2024  The New York Times Company \nSUNDAY, JULY 21, 2024 \n# \n# \nVolodymyr Vakulenko, whose son, the Ukrainian writer of the same name, was arrested and killed by occupying forces in 2022. \nStrategy of Attack Ads and Legal Wrangling \n‘THE DAM HAS BROKEN’ \nStung by Obama’s Silence as Allies Make Their Unease Public \n# \nDonald J. Trump’s campaign is preparing a major effort to attack Vice President Kamala Harris if President Biden steps aside as the Democratic nominee, including a wave of ads focusing on her record in her current office and in Califor- nia, according to two people briefed on the matter. \nThis article is by  Peter Baker ,  Mi- chael D. Shear  and  Katie Rogers . \nWASHINGTON — Sick with Covid and abandoned by allies, President Biden has been fuming at his Delaware beach house, in- creasingly resentful about what he sees as an orchestrated cam- paign to drive him out of the race and bitter toward some of those he once considered close, including his onetime running mate Barack Obama. \nThe Trump team has already prepared  opposition  research books on Ms. Harris, and has simi- lar dossiers on other Democrats who could become the nominee if Mr. Biden were to drop out of the race. \nBut the bulk of the preparations so far have been focused on Ms. Harris, including a recently con- cluded poll testing her vulnerabili- ties in a general election contest, according to the two people. The Trump team’s attention on Ms. Harris is based on its assumption that if Democrats were to bypass the first Black woman to serve as vice president, it would drive even deeper divisions in the party and risk alienating their base of Black voters. \nMr. Biden has been around poli- tics long enough to assume that the leaks appearing in the media in recent days are being coordi- nated to raise the pressure on him to step aside, according to people close to him. He considers Repre- sentative Nancy Pelosi, the for- mer House speaker, the main in- stigator, but is irritated at Mr. Obama as well, seeing him as a puppet master behind the scenes. The friction between the sitting president and leaders of his party so close to an election is unlike anything seen in Washington in generations — especially because the Democrats now working to ease him out were some of the al- lies most critical to his success. It was Mr. Obama who elevated Mr. Biden from a presidential also-ran to the vice presidency, setting him up to win the White House in 2020, and it was Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate Dem- ocratic  leader,  who  pushed through his landmark legislative achievements. \n# \n# \nTrump allies have also begun examining the records of Demo- cratic governors who are consid- ered potential running mates for Ms. Harris. Advisers to the former president are paying especially close attention to Gov. Josh Sha- piro of Pennsylvania — the state the Trump campaign is most fo- cused on winning to block the Democrats’ path to the White House. \nIn May, in a final blow, Russian missiles blew up the printing plant in Kharkiv that had published the work. That strike killed seven em- ployees, wounded 22 others and destroyed  about  a  third  of Ukraine’s overall book-printing capacity. \n# \n# \nFrom Russian Forces Under Cherry Tree \nKHARKIV, Ukraine — After Russian forces took control of his village in 2022, Volodymyr Vaku- lenko, a well-known Ukrainian au- thor, sensed he might soon be ar- rested. So he buried his new hand- written manuscript in his back- yard, under a cherry tree. \n# \npeople neglecting their flower beds, cooking on campfires as util- ities failed, and even fraternizing with the Russians. Soon enough, Russian soldiers indeed arrested Mr. Vakulenko, and his body later turned up in a mass grave. Six months later, a fellow Ukrainian  author,  Viktoria Amelina, learned of the buried book, dug it up, wrote a foreword and sent it to a publisher. But she too was killed, in a missile strike \nDespite the anguish that ac- companied it, the book, “I Trans- form: A Diary of Occupation and Selected Poems,” ended up on shelves of Ukrainian bookstores and is on sale today. Rescued from the dirt, the book stands as a sym- bol of an enduring Ukrainian liter- ary life even as Russian forces try to snuff it out. \nThis article is by  Aaron Boxer- man ,  Ronen Bergman ,  Shuaib Al- mosawa  and  Eric Schmitt . \nA Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seek- ing comment. \nBest known in Ukraine for his cheerful and lyrical children’s books,  Mr.  Vakulenko  was seething with anger at Moscow’s occupying forces. As his village lost cellphone service and news from the outside world dried up, he filled his new work with reflec- tive, sometimes morose, descrip- tions of life under Russian control: \nJERUSALEM — Israeli fighter jets bombed a port in Yemen con- trolled by the Iran-backed Houthi militia on Saturday in retaliation for the group’s deadly drone at- tack in Tel Aviv a day earlier. It was the first time Israel has pub- licly struck the group after months of escalating Houthi at- tacks. \nBrian  Fallon,  a  campaign spokesman for Ms. Harris, said in a statement: “After tanking the bi- partisan border deal, Donald Trump has resorted to lying about the vice president’s record. As a former district attorney and attor- ney general, she has stood up to fraudsters and felons like Trump her entire career. Trump’s lies won’t stop her from continuing to prosecute the case against him on the biggest issues in this race.” Since Mr. Biden’s disastrous de- Continued on Page 20 \nBut several people close to Mr. Biden, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal matters, de- scribed  an  under-the-weather president coughing and hacking over a hundred miles from the cor- ridors of power as his presidency meets its most perilous moment. He has watched with rising ex- asperation as a succession of news stories appeared reporting that Mr. Schumer, Ms. Pelosi, Mr.  Continued on Page 17 \nThe deaths of Mr. Vakulenko and Ms. Amelina, and the scene of  \nThe airstrikes targeted a power station as well as gas and oil de- pots in the area of the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, according to a Houthi spokesman and two re- gional officials, who spoke on con- dition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak pub- licly. \nAsha’s Farm Sanctuary in Newfane, N.Y., was the center of a bitter fight over livestock and lifestyle. \n# \nIsrael said it had struck sites used for military purposes, al- though Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, said that Israel had attacked some “dual use” targets that have civil- ian and military functions. \n\nThis article is by  Emily Cochrane , Steve Eder ,  William K. Rashbaum , Amy Julia Harris ,  Jack Healy  and Glenn Thrush . \nAdmiral Hagari said the opera- tion was “one of the farthest and longest ever conducted by the Is- raeli air force.” He called the port a major supply stop for Iran to fun- nel weapons to its Houthi allies in Yemen, who have fired more than 200 missiles and drones at Israel over the past several months. \nBETHEL PARK, Pa. — For Thomas Crooks, the suburban Pittsburgh nursing home where he served meals and washed dish- es for \\$16 an hour was another solitary corner of a nearly invisi- ble life. He was polite but distant, a former co-worker said, ate lunch alone in the break room and rarely spoke with anyone. \nOfficials are seeking a motive in the Trump rally shooting. \nBut the Hodeidah port is also a crucial point for all goods, includ- ing desperately needed food and oil, to enter northwestern Yemen, much of which is controlled by the Houthis; at least two-thirds of the impoverished country’s popula- tion lives under the group’s rule. \nkilled by the Secret Service, his ideology and motives remain a vexing question for investigators and the people who crossed paths with him. \nBut as western Pennsylvania geared up last week for the bois- terous spectacle of hosting a rally for former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Crooks approached his bosses with a request, law en- forcement  officials  said:  He wanted to take Saturday off. He told them he had something important to do. \n# \nThe Ministry of Health in Houthi-controlled Sana, Yemen’s capital, said at least 80 people were wounded in the attack, most of them with severe burns, ac- cording to The Associated Press. Yahya  Sarea,  the  Houthi spokesman, said that the strike on the port would not deter the mili- tia from engaging in additional at- tacks against Israel. The group says it fires munitions at Israel as  \nphy, the sanctuary’s owner, found the cows in her yard. She herded them into a pen, she said, and im- mediately notified the local ani- mal control agency. Six days later, an investigator with the agency came to check in on the cows. He interviewed people around the area and learned that a neighbor, Scott Gregson, was missing a heifer and a steer. Clearly, the  Continued on Page 15 \nonto a neighbor’s yard. This type of thing sometimes happens in rural western New York, where pastures and farms stretch for miles. But Hornee and Blackee had crossed not into an- other farm but into an animal sanctuary whose owner saves livestock from slaughter and en- courages visitors to become veg- ans. \nIn dozens of interviews, former classmates, teachers and neigh- bors said they still could not square their memories of Mr. Crooks — an awkward, intelligent teenager who liked to tinker with computers and spent his week- ends playing video games — with the image of the stringy-haired gunman at the rally, armed with his father’s AR-15-style rifle as he  Continued on Page 16 \n# \nNEWFANE, N.Y. — One sum- mer day, a cow and a steer walked away from their farm. The cow was black and was named Blac- kee. The steer was golden brown, with two stubby horns. He was named Hornee. \nIt was one of the few hints to emerge so far that the 20-year-old engineering sciences graduate was planning to become a political assassin.
