But he rejected Republican calls to deploy the National Guard to rein in the campuses. \n“There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos,” Mr. Biden said in his first personal re- marks on the campus fray in 10 days. “People have the right to get an education, the right to get a de- gree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of be- ing attacked.” Antisemitism, he added, “has no place” in America. The  president’s  comments came as universities across the nation continued to struggle to re- store order. Police officers in riot gear arrested about 200 people as they cleared a protest encamp- ment at the University of Califor- nia, Los Angeles, while other offi- cers removed demonstrators oc- cupying a library at Portland State University in Oregon. Activ- ists erected 30 tents at the Univer- sity of Wisconsin-Madison a day after the police removed tents and detained 34 people.

Now, on the 150th anni- versary of America’s most famous \n# \nTEL AVIV — Nearing the end of a whirlwind Middle East trip this week, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken finished meet- ings with the Israeli president and relatives of American hos- tages held by Hamas, left his beachside hotel in Tel Aviv and shook hands with protesters gathered outside. \nBenjamin Netanyahu has avoided since the war began in October. And, lately, he has fo- cused his recent public com- ments on an imminent ground offensive — an invasion of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza “with or without” a cease-fire deal, as the Israeli leader put it on Tuesday. \nMr. Baffert died in races sur- rounding the Belmont Stakes, the third leg, in June. \nother formidable foe: itself. Last year, beneath Churchill Downs’s iconic twin spires, seven horses died during the week of the showpiece event — two of them in races in the hours leading up to the Derby. In the days after, five more sustained fatal injuries, prompting Churchill officials to move their races to another Ken- tucky racetrack. \nAt the historic Saratoga Race Course in New York, 13 horses died while racing and training at the sport’s signature summer meet, including two who seemed poised to win their races before breaking down near the finish line on nationally televised broad- casts. \n“There’s a genuine feeling that this is the inflection point, and if we don’t act, it may be too late,” said Lisa Lazarus, the chief execu- tive of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, or HISA, the federal agency that now regulates the sport. \nContinued on Page A21 \n\nThough it was not the first time Mr. Netanyahu had prom- ised to invade the last Hamas stronghold in Gaza, U.S. officials were taken aback by the timing of the comment. Threatening an offensive in Rafah can put pres- sure on Hamas to take the deal — but only if Hamas leaders think freeing hostages for Pales- tinian prisoners and a six-week pause in fighting could eventu- ally lead to a permanent cease- Continued on Page A10 \nHe looked them in the eye and said there was a new hostages- for-cease-fire deal on the table that Hamas should take. “Bringing your loved ones home is at the heart of every- thing we’re trying to do, and we will not rest until everyone — man, woman, soldier, civilian, young, old — is back home,” he said. \nIn Louisville, Ky., on Saturday, racing officials and horse lovers will hold their collective breath and hope that every horse com- Continued on Page A22 \nOver the past 12 months, The New York Times analyzed confi- dential documents and covert re- cordings made by law enforce- ment, and obtained exclusive in- terviews as part of an investiga- tion into why so many horses, supposedly in peak physical con- dition, were breaking down so fre- quently.

They told the li- brarians they were Ukrainians fleeing war and asked to consult 19th-century first editions of works by Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s national poet, and Nikolai Gogol. \n# \nWASHINGTON — In October 1984, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was invited to ad- dress a conservative Baptist church near Wilmington as he campaigned for a third term. Mr. Biden, hardly the favorite of social conservatives, was in hos- tile political territory. But as the incumbent, he was given the first speaking slot — and he used it to hold  court  uninterrupted  for nearly an hour. Mr. Biden’s Repub- lican opponent barely got to intro- duce himself before time was up for the event, while the dozens of other candidates there for the for- um never got a word in. The episode, from “Only in Del- aware,” a political history of Dela- ware by Celia Cohen, a longtime Wilmington journalist, illustrates just how easily Mr. Biden was able to sweep challengers to the side — not just in that race, but through- \nout his Senate career. Incumben- cy gave him a staggering advan- tage. \nIn 30 years, Mr. Biden never en- countered a serious threat to his office. His Republican opponents were underfunded, little-known, inexperienced or some combina- tion of the three. None of them took more than 41 percent of the vote against him. \nSpeaking Russian, they said they were an uncle and nephew researching censorship in czarist Russia so the nephew could apply for a scholarship to the United States. \nHis re-election fight against for- mer President Donald J.
