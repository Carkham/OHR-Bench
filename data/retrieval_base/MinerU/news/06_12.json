Only two years ago Africa’s biggest economy, Ni- geria is projected to drop to fourth place this year. \nThis article is by  Glenn Thrush , Eileen Sullivan  and  Zach Monta- gue . \nWILMINGTON, Del. — A jury on Tuesday found Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, guilty of three felony counts for lying on a federal firearms application, a shattering blow for the Biden fam- ily in the middle of an unforgiving presidential election campaign. The verdict brought an end to an extraordinary seven-day trial that made painfully public Mr. Bi- den’s crack addiction, reckless be- havior and ruinous spending — narrated by three former roman- tic partners, including the widow of his brother, Beau Biden, and by the defendant himself in the pages of his memoir. \nThe pain is widespread. Unions strike to protest salaries of around \\$20 a month. People die in stam- pedes, desperate for free sacks of rice. Hospitals are overrun with women wracked by spasms from calcium deficiencies. \nThe crisis is largely believed to be rooted in two major changes implemented  by  a  president elected 15 months ago: the partial removal of fuel subsidies and the floating of the currency, which to- gether have caused major price rises. \nA nation of entrepreneurs, Ni- geria’s more than 200 million citi- zens are skilled at managing in tough circumstances, without the services states usually provide. They generate their own electrici- ty and source their own water. They take up arms and defend their  communities  when  the armed forces cannot. They negoti- ate with kidnappers when family members are abducted. \nThe charges that Mr. Biden was convicted of stem from the pur- chase of a Colt pistol in October 2018, and also included illegal pos- session of a weapon after falsely claiming to be drug-free on the standard background check re- quired in all firearms transac- tions. \n# \nlesser known of two candidates in the Democratic primary who are challenging longtime Assembly- man Ron Kim in a predominantly Asian district east of La Guardia Airport. \nlisted as giving \\$50. Under New York State’s new generous system for publicly fi- nancing political campaigns, Mr. Yin claimed the Zadrans’ modest donations as eligible for   $\\S1{,}380$   in matching funds. Yet in interviews, the Zadrans said they had not giv- en money to Mr. Yin, nor had they even heard of him. \n# \n# \n# \nIn the heart of Flushing, Queens, a second-floor apartment seemed to be a modest hotbed of interest in a local State Assembly race, with three family members donating small amounts of cash to an obscure Democrat, according to campaign records. \nMr. Biden, 54, faces up to 25 years in prison, although federal sentencing guidelines call for a fraction of that penalty. First-time offenders who did not use their weapons to commit violent crimes receive relatively light sentences, and prosecutors suggested they would not seek a sentence more severe than for any other person convicted in such a case. \nBut right now, their resourceful- ness is being stretched to the limit. On a recent morning in a corner of the biggest emergency room in northern Nigeria, three women were  convulsing  in  painful spasms, unable to speak. Each year, the E.R. at Murtala Muham- med Specialist Hospital in Kano, \nDespite his lack of name recog- nition, Mr. Yin is now one of New York’s top recipients of public matching funds — \\$162,800 at last count — after reporting the high- est percentage of cash, the least traceable form of donation, of any state candidate who received matching funds this year. \nAhmad Zadran said. “I never do- nate a penny to anybody.” The Zadrans are among scores of New Yorkers who supposedly made small cash donations to Mr. Yin, a businessman who immi- grated to New York from Shang- hai in the late 1990s. He is the \n“This is crazy,” Raheem Zadran, 27, said. “I never donated to this guy.

When it was all over, he hugged and kissed his wife, Melis- sa Cohen Biden. \n# \n\n\n“I am more grateful today for the love and support I experi- enced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends and my community than I am disap- pointed by the outcome,” he said in a statement shortly after. \nMr. Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Low- ell, suggested that he might ap- peal, vowing to “vigorously pur- sue all the legal challenges avail- able to Hunter.” \nFARGO, N.D. — For months, as the  presidential  election  has drawn closer, a debate over the age of American politicians has swirled: Is there a point at which candidates should be deemed too old to run? Should age even mat- ter? \nIt is unclear what, if any, politi- cal implications the verdict will have. Former President Donald J. Trump, facing two federal indict- ments, pounced on the conviction. But other Republicans have ex- pressed skepticism about the trial, and Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican allied with Mr. Trump, said on social me- dia that the conviction was “kinda dumb.” \nGranted, the ballot question on age limits for politicians posed to North Dakotans took the tem- perature of voters in a single state — and one of the nation’s least populous states at that, with some 779,000 residents. Experts say the measure would almost certainly face a legal challenge if it were to pass. And, technically, this pro- posed age limit pertains only to North Dakota candidates for Con- gress, not the presidency or any other office. \n“The system in Washington is broken, and Americans know it,” said Jay Carson, once a Democratic insider, with his daughter. \nBut the verdict was nothing short of a personal catastrophe for Mr. Biden. \n# \nA year ago, Mr. Biden, who has been  sober  since  mid-2019, reached a plea agreement with the government that would have allowed him to participate in a counseling program for people who commit nonviolent firearms offenses in lieu of prosecution or prison time. But the deal imploded Continued on Page A14 \n# \nLOS ANGELES — In his out- sider bid for the White House, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is flanked by a team of unlikely political charac- ters: new age health gurus, anti- vaccine activists, social media in- fluencers, veterans of fringe third- party campaigns, cryptocurrency evangelists and militant envi- ronmentalists. Jay Carson may be the most un- \nmy favorite people in the world.” He left politics more than a dec- ade ago for show business, becom- ing a producer on “House of Cards” and the creator of “The Morning Show.” He got divorced, got sober — he met Mr. Kennedy at one of his first 12-step meetings — remarried and settled into a new life in Topanga Canyon, Calif., with no plans to return to a cam- paign. \nStill, amid all the chatter about age in 2024, this ballot measure provides a rare chance to learn what at least one set of voters in the nation’s middle thinks about older elected officials. “Most people think it’s common sense that politicians should re- tire at some point,” said Jared Hendrix, a Republican politician in Fargo who led efforts to gather signatures to put the question be- fore voters. “I think it’s very possi- ble that if we pull this off here, other states will follow.” If approved, the ballot measure would amend the state’s Constitu- tion, barring candidates from run- ning for Congress if they would turn 81 or older by the end of the year before their term ends.
