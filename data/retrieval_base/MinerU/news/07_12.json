The people closest to him are adamant he will stay in the race. \n# \nEven Some of His Own Aides Are Weighing How to Persuade Him to Drop Out \ncording to people familiar with this thinking, and who is unlikely to be persuaded otherwise by peo- ple outside his insular inner circle, which includes his family. \n# \nWASHINGTON — President Biden found himself increasingly isolated on Thursday as a small group of his longtime aides and advisers have become convinced that he will have to make what they see as the painful but inevita- ble decision to abandon his cam- paign for re-election, according to three people who have been briefed on the matter. \nMr. Biden was hoping to put some concerns to rest in a high- stakes news conference on Thurs- day night after the NATO summit in Washington. In an early stum- ble before it even got underway, he flubbed his introduction of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, saying, “Ladies and gen- tlemen, President Putin.” \nIn recent days, the group has been trying to come up with ways to persuade Mr. Biden to step aside from the campaign. Those discussions were recounted by three people familiar with them who, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of ano- nymity to discuss a sensitive situ- ation. There is no indication that any of the discussions have reached Mr. Biden himself, one of the informed people said. \nAfter a moment, Mr. Biden real- ized his mistake, came back to the microphone and quickly said: “President Putin? We’re going to beat President Putin. President Zelensky. I’m so focused on beat- ing Putin, we got to worry about it.” \nThe small group of Mr. Biden’s advisers in the administration and the campaign — at least two of whom have told allies that they do not believe he should keep trying to run for a second term — said they would need to convince the president of several things for him to leave the race. \nThe effort comes after a disas- trous debate performance in At- lanta two weeks ago plunged Mr. Biden’s candidacy into crisis. He is facing pressure from all sides: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are vacillating between tepid support and outright calls for him to drop out, and those calls were being echoed by some of the wealthiest donors in the party. \n# \n# \nThey said they would have to make the case that he cannot win against Mr. Trump. They would have to convince him that another candidate, like Vice President Ka- mala Harris, could beat Mr. Trump. And they would have to assure Mr. Biden that, should he step aside, the process to choose  Continued on Page A18 \nService office wrote on social me- dia on Wednesday. “Well, the air- port hit 118°F.” \n# \n# \nThursday was not shaping up to be much of a reprieve, at all. \nLAS VEGAS — For their anni- versary road trip through the West, an escape from the humid misery of a Louisiana summer, Tyson and Adeline Maddox rented a glimmering convertible.

Dangerously high temperatures are forecast to last there through Saturday, and shift east to the central and east- ern U.S. by Sunday. \nAt the center of it all is Mr. Bi- den, who is convinced that he is the only one who can beat former President Donald J.

But  regardless  of whether they render a guilty ver- dict, the messages and photos ex- tracted from phones seized by the F.B.I. and introduced as evidence have revealed how Egyptian intel- ligence officials were able to culti- vate casual access to one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington. \n# \n“Remember 20 minutes ago when hitting   $117^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F}$  was a big deal?” the local National Weather \nMILWAUKEE — Mayor Cava- lier Johnson was zipping in and out of Milwaukee’s City Hall this week,  shuttling  his  children around town, meeting with his chief of staff and watching excit- edly outside as tents sprang up near the site of the Republican Na- tional Convention. \n“It’s like being in front of an exhaust pipe,” said a visitor to Las Vegas, where temperatures soared. \nSHELLEY DUVALL, 1949-2024 \n# \nMr. Menendez, the New Jersey senator who at the time led the Senate Foreign Relations Com- mittee and had broad authority over foreign military aid, was of- ten only a text message away from some of Egypt’s most power- ful leaders.

Mr. Johnson, 37, is preparing for his biggest and trickiest role yet. He was one of the major support- ers of bringing the Republican convention to Milwaukee, and next week, the crush of tens of thousands of visitors will arrive.

She was 75. \nThe electronic exchanges have shown the degree to which mod- ern communication methods have altered  criminal  prosecutions.

Taken with her, they introduced her to Mr. Altman, a director with his own reputation for oddball movies and offbeat casting. He immediately asked her to join the cast, despite her lack of training. She said yes — and went on to appear in an unbroken string of five more Altman movies: “Mc- Cabe and Mrs. Miller” (1971), “Thieves Like Us” (1974), “Nash- ville” (1975), “Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History  Continued on Page A23 \n# \nwars, posted a call in March for residents with gun permits and an interest in becoming “provisional emergency special deputy sher- iffs.” \nMr. Blakeman said in an inter- view that the program was about “providing another layer of pro- tection” for residents. “I didn’t want to be in a situation where we had a major emergency and we needed help and people were not properly vetted or trained,” he said. \n# \n# \nThe leader of a New York City suburb is recruiting 75 armed citi- zens, many of them former police officers, for a force of “special dep- uties” to be activated whenever he chooses. \nhave a great time here,” Mr. John- son said in an interview. “At the same time, on the political end, I am a Democrat.” \nThe posting called the initiative a strategy to assist in the “protec- tion of human life and property during an emergency” such as a hurricane or blackout — and per- haps, Mr. Blakeman later added, “a riot.” \nIsland county, which is one of the country’s safest, protected by one of the largest police departments.
