No. 60,191 \n© 2024  The New York Times Company \n# \nWILLIE MAYS, 1931-2024 \n# \n# \n# \n\nThere’s ‘Good and Bad’ in Social Media Use \nGANGS IMPERIL ROUTES \nMoscow Aid Amplifies Nuclear Fears in West \n# \nSupply Convoys to Gaza Stall With No Police to Deter Attacks \nWhen the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, announced on Monday that he was planning to push for a mental health warning label on social media platforms, he was met with cheers from many parents and teachers, who de- scribed a long, lonely struggle to wrench children away from a hab- it that was hurting them. \n# \nAs Vladimir V . Putin’s Russia and Xi Jinping’s China deepened their confrontation with the West over the past decade, they were always united with the United States on at least one geopolitical project: dismantling or at least containing North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. \n# \nCAIRO — The extreme anarchy that has gripped the Gaza Strip is making it too dangerous and diffi- cult to distribute desperately needed aid in the south, relief groups and others say, despite a daily pause in fighting that Israel is observing along a key road there. \nHe got a cooler reaction, howev- er, from some scientists who study the relationship between social media and mental health. In inter- views, several researchers said the blanket warning Dr. Murthy has proposed — “social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents” — stretches and oversimplifies the scientific evidence. \nUkraine broke out two years ago. In one of the starkest back-to- the-Cold War moments yet, Mr. Putin’s visit Wednesday to Pyongyang — and the announce- ment of a pact to provide “mutu- al assistance in the event of aggression” — underscored that efforts by the world’s three big- gest nuclear powers to halt nu- clear proliferation by North Korea had been dying for some time. Mr. Putin and Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, just presided over the memorial service. \nDays after the pause took hold, over 1,000 truckloads of supplies remained stranded in Gaza near the Kerem Shalom border cross- ing with Israel, with thousands of tons of food, medicine and other goods mere miles from Palestin- ians who need them, aid groups and Israeli officials say. \nFor many years, researchers have tried to determine whether the amount of time a child spent on social media contributed to poor mental health, and “the re- sults have been really mixed, with probably the consensus being that no, it’s not related,” said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, the chief science officer at the American Psychological As- sociation. \nThe threat of looting and at- tacks by armed gangs have forced relief groups to stop delivering as- sistance in southern Gaza. Trucks using supply routes have been rid- dled with bullet holes. Business- people sending commercial goods into the territory and aid agencies \nMr. Putin did far more than drop any semblance of a desire to ensure nuclear restraint. He promised unspecified technolog- ical help that — if it includes the few critical technologies Mr. Kim has sought to perfect — could help the North design a warhead that could survive re-entry into the atmosphere and threaten its many adversaries, starting with the United States. \nWhat seems to matter more, he said, is what they are doing when they are online — content about self-harm, for example, has been shown to increase self-harming behavior. \n\n“It’s kind of like saying, ‘Is the number of calories that you eat good for you or bad for you?’” said Dr. Prinstein, who testified before the Senate on the subject last year. “It depends. Is it candy, or is it veg- etables? If your child is spending all day on social media following The New York Times feed and talking about it with their friends, that’s probably fine, you know?” Like other scientists inter- viewed, Dr. Prinstein applauded Dr. Murthy for drawing attention to the mental health crisis. He said he was very optimistic about pol- icy changes that might follow, to keep social media use from inter- fering with school, sleep and phys- ical activity. After Dr. Murthy’s an- nouncement, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called for a statewide ban on smartphone use in Califor- nia schools. \nNowhere in the statements made Wednesday was there even a hint that North Korea should give up any of its estimated 50 or 60 nuclear weapons. To the con- trary, Mr. Putin declared: “Pyongyang has the right to take reasonable measures to strengthen its own defense capa- bility, ensure national security and protect sovereignty” — though he did not address whether those measures includ- ed further developing the North’s nuclear weapons. \nWillie Mays during batting practice in 1954.

As a result, the Israeli military’s decision to pause fighting for hours each day along the aid route has so far produced scant humani- tarian benefit. The grim situation is part of the domino effect of the Israeli cam- paign in Gaza, which has toppled much of the Hamas government without any civilian administra- tion to take its place.

But he did more than personify the complete ballplayer.

Jeff Landry signed legislation on Wednesday requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public classroom in Louisiana, making the state the only one with such a mandate and reigniting the de- bate over how porous the bound- ary between church and state should be. \nAs Russian aerial bombard- ments of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s sec- ond-largest city, have intensified, the evacuation of Plombir, a 15- year-old male, and Miranda, a 14- year-old female, came just in time, \n“If you want to respect the rule of law,” he said, “you’ve got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.” \nThe legislation is part of a broader campaign by conserva- tive Christian groups to amplify public expressions of faith, and provoke lawsuits that could reach the Supreme Court, where they expect a friendlier reception than in years past. That presumption is rooted in recent rulings, particu- larly one in 2022 in which the court sided with a high school football coach who argued that he had a constitutional right to pray at the 50-yard line after games. “The climate is certainly bet- \n“If they had continued in Kharkiv, their chances of survival would have been very slim,” said Daniel Garcia-Párraga, director of zoological  operations  at Oceanogràfic de Valencia, who \nCritics, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Founda- tion, vowed a legal fight against the law they deemed “blatantly unconstitutional.” But it is a battle that proponents are prepared, and in many ways, eager, to take on. “I can’t wait to be sued,” Mr. Landry said on Saturday at a Re- publican fund-raiser in Nashville, according to The Tennessean. And on Wednesday, as he signed the measure, he argued that the Ten Commandments contained valu- \nBelugas, whose natural habitat is the Arctic, need cold water to survive.
