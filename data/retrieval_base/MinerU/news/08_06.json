Mehta of U.S. Dis- trict Court for the District of Co- lumbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monop- oly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of il- legally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other compa- nies, like Apple and Samsung, bil- lions of dollars a year to have Google  automatically  handle search queries on their smart- phones and web browsers. “After having carefully consid- \nAnxiety over a slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Mon- day, with a retreat in markets that began last week snowballing into a global rout. \nThe turmoil was the latest ex- ample of how distinct economic forces can ricochet across mar- kets, forcing down company stock prices and erasing billions of dol- lars in value. In this case, a rapidly rising yen over the past week had disrupted the flow of global capi- tal, prompting a pullback from some popular investments. \nBut the sell-off quickly ex- panded into a more widespread panic that the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start cutting interest rates, threatening the strength of the U.S. economy. Those fears were amplified by a U.S. employment report released on Friday that showed signifi- cantly slower hiring by employ- ers, with the unemployment rate rising to its highest level in nearly three years. From the moment stock markets first opened for trading in Asia, and then through trading hours in Europe and the United States on Monday, prices plummeted. \n# \n# \nThe ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology com- panies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume informa- tion and search online — and indi- cates a potential limit of Big Tech’s power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust law- suits against Google, Apple, Ama- zon and Meta, the owner of Face- book, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust rul- ing against a tech company tar- geted Microsoft more than two decades ago. \nRussia, and before it the Soviet Union, has a long history of invest- ing heavily in so-called “illegals,” spies who burrow deep into target countries over many years. Un- like “legal” spies operating under diplomatic cover in Russian em- bassies, they have no immunity from prosecution or obvious con- nections to Russia and are ex- tremely hard to detect. \n# \n# \nLJUBLJANA,  Slovenia  — Darja Stefancic, a painter in Slov- enia known for brightly colored landscapes, thought it strange when an obscure online art gallery run by a woman from Ar- gentina contacted her out of the blue and asked her to join its thin roster of artists. \n# \n# \nfor Russian intelligence, part of an elaborate network of deep-cover sleeper spies trained to imperson- ate Argentines, Brazilians and other foreign nationals by Rus- sia’s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, around Europe.

DHAKA, Bangladesh — They came prepared for violence. A day after about 100 people were killed in antigovernment protests, hun- dreds of thousands took to the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, defying a curfew imposed by the government and demand- ing the resignation of Prime Min- ister Sheikh Hasina. \ncline since September 2022. While some investors saw the sell-off as a signal that the econ- omy was at risk of recession, oth- ers maintained that the move was more the result of a pullback from overextended bets, especially on tech stocks and artificial intelli- gence. Despite its recent decline, the S&P 500 is still up nearly 9 per- cent for the year, a healthy return. “Markets are a little bit out of control,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. “This is just total panic. It’s not real but it is painful, and it could be with us for a few weeks.” Few corners of the financial market were spared from the tur- moil as investors cashed out and sought refuge from a broad-based slump.

The ruling could have major rami- fications for Google’s success, es- pecially as it spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month. \nIt did — but in ways that far sur- passed even her darkest suspi- cions. \nDISSENT  A dissident released in the Russian prisoner swap says he didn’t want to leave.

After 15 years of increasingly autocratic rule during which she crushed the opposition and brought the armed forces and the judiciary under her control, Ms. Hasina bowed to pressure and, according to the military, quit her post and fled the country in a helicopter. \nSimone Biles has pushed women’s gymnastics forward with some of the hardest moves in history. \nThe downfall of her govern- ment, in a country known for its messy and sometimes bloody poli- tics, plunged the country into law- less uncertainty and all but guar- anteed that there will be a fresh battle for power between leaders of her political party, the Awami League, and the Bangladesh Na- tionalist Party, its main opposi- tion. \n# \nIt remained unclear what role the military, which has seized power in the past, will play — or whether it had a hand in persuad- ing Ms. Hasina to leave. On Mon- day afternoon, Gen. Waker-uz-Za- man, the Bangladesh Army chief of staff, announced her departure and said he would request the for- mation of an interim government. Neither Ms. Hasina, 76, nor the Awami League made any public comment on the head-spinning turn of events, which few people had predicted. \n\n# \nSAN DIEGO — When Roy Cockrum, a onetime struggling actor and a former monk, won a \\$259 million Powerball jackpot in 2014, he decided to splurge on something a bit out of the ordi- nary: supporting nonprofit the- ater. \nHe set up a foundation that has given away \\$25 million to 39 American theaters so far, which is why he found himself the other night at the Old Globe in San Diego. He was there to watch the premiere of a production he sup- ported to help the theater reach a milestone: a large-scale staging of the only Shakespeare play it had yet to produce, an adaptation of the somewhat rarely performed three “Henry VI” plays. “The question I put to artistic directors is, ‘Is there a project you’ve always dreamed of doing that you couldn’t afford?’” Cock- rum, an apple-cheeked, snowy- haired 68-year-old, said in an in- terview. “To help artistic directors \n# \nThe recent unrest began with student-led  demonstrations against a quota system for gov- ernment jobs, but they quickly broadened into protests against a government seen as increasingly authoritarian, and were met with a brutal crackdown.

As a result, she did not win, as ex- pected. Instead, she received the silver medal, while Rebeca An- drade of Brazil, her rival, won the gold by just over three-hun- dredths of a point.
