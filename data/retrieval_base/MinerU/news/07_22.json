Below, a portion of his letter. \nFacing Pressure, He Writes, ‘It’s Time to Come Together and Beat Trump’ \n# \nPresident Biden on Sunday abruptly abandoned his campaign for a second term under intense pressure from fellow Democrats and threw his support to Vice President Kamala Harris to lead their party in a dramatic last- minute bid to stop former Presi- dent Donald J. Trump from re- turning to the White House. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Presi- dent,” Mr. Biden said in a letter posted on social media. “And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the re- mainder of my term.” Mr. Biden then posted a subse- quent online message endorsing Ms. Harris. “My very first deci- sion as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” he wrote. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.” \nThe president’s decision up- ended the race and set the stage for a raucous and unpredictable campaign unlike any in modern times, leaving Ms. Harris just 107 days to consolidate support from Democrats, establish herself as a credible national leader and pros- ecute the case against Mr. Trump. Recent polls have shown her com- petitive with and even slightly ahead of Mr. Trump. \nAlthough Democratic conven- tion delegates must ratify the choice of Ms. Harris to take over as standard-bearer next month, Mr. Biden’s endorsement meant the nomination was hers to lose and she appeared in a powerful position to claim it. While Mr. Bi- den, 81, remained president and still planned to finish out his term in January, the transition of the campaign to Ms. Harris, 59, amounted to a momentous gener- ational change of leadership of the Democratic Party. The president said he would “speak to the nation later this \n# \nVice President Kamala Harris vowed to win the nomination. \n# \nWASHINGTON — Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris, who has struggled for nearly four years in President Biden’s shadow, was thrust on Sunday into the center of a remarkable political drama that could culminate with her becom- ing the first woman of color at the top of a major-party presidential ticket. \nMr. Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid and endorse Ms. Harris to succeed him puts her in a powerful, but not certain, position to become the new face of the Democratic Party, charged with preventing former President Donald J.

The end of Mr. Biden’s candidacy on Sunday shifted some Democrats’ emotions from profound anxiety to hopeful deter- mination, even if what comes next for their party remains unclear.

Just last week- end, Mr. Rylance participated in a demonstration outside of the Ohio Democratic Party convention call- ing for Mr. Biden to step aside. “If Biden had stayed in, we would have lost absolutely every- thing,” he added, echoing the feel- ings of many Democrats. “We would have lost the House, would have lost the Senate, and it could \nThis article is by  Patricia Mazzei , Mitch Smith  and  Heather Knight . MIAMI — For Democratic vot- ers who have spent much of the summer brooding about Presi- dent Biden’s fitness for office, his decision on Sunday not to seek re- election came as a relief.
