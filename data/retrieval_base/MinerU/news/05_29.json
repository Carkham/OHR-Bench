Ms. Kling never thought of herself as someone who would choose abortion. \nConcerns Rise as U.S. Relies on SpaceX \n# \nWASHINGTON — Elon Musk aggressively elbowed his way into the space launch business over the past two decades, combining engineering genius and an entre- preneurial drive with a demand that the U.S. government stop fa- voring the big, slow-moving con- tractors that had long dominated the industry. \nToday, it is Mr. Musk who is dominant. His company, SpaceX, is the primary provider of launch services to NASA and to the Pen- tagon. His rockets carry far more commercial satellites into orbit than anyone else’s, including those for his own Starlink commu- nications network. He has set new standards for reaching space cheaply and reliably. \nBut in one striking way, the for- mer outsider has come to resem- ble the entrenched contractors he once fought to topple: He is in- creasingly using his vast power and influence to try to keep emerging rivals at bay, his com- petitors say, even as his success is prompting qualms within the gov- ernment about such heavy reli- ance on a mercurial billionaire. \n# \n# \nwondered, why are we not the poster child for abortion rights?” said Riata Little Walker, who trav- eled from her home in Casper, Wyo., for an abortion in Colorado at 22 weeks, after doctors diag- nosed Down syndrome and a heart defect in her fetus, which they said would require surgery and later a transplant if it sur- vived until delivery. \n# \n# \nentrepreneurs trying to emulate Mr. Musk is sufficiently con- cerned about what they see as his anticompetitive tactics that some of them are now willing to take him on publicly. \nFor a long time, many women who had abortions because of cat- astrophic fetal diagnoses told their stories only privately. Griev- ing  pregnancies  they  dearly wanted and fearing the stigma of abortion, they sought the closely guarded comfort of online com- munities identified by the way many doctors had described the procedure — TFMR, or “termina- tion for medical reasons.” \n# \n# \n# \ntion’s post-Roe debate, speaking out against bans with their stories of being forced across state lines and left to feel like criminals in seeking care. \nJoe Perez is exactly the type of voter President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump are fighting over: A 22-year-old His- panic man in Las Vegas who grew up leaning Republican, he also supports abortion rights and was turned off by the Capitol rioters on Jan. 6, 2021. \nTim Ellis started Relativity Space after being inspired by Mr. Musk’s pursuit of a rocket that could carry humans to Mars. Then he heard from other industry ex- ecutives that individuals with ties to SpaceX were trying to block his efforts to raise money for his own Mars project. \n“Yes, your body, your choice, but that’s not the story that pulls people in,” she said. “We have to bring our stories to the front be- cause otherwise it’s so easy for those over here to do, ‘But they’re killing babies.’” \nMany of these women started out opposing abortion, but as they have changed their minds, they have changed the way Americans speak about it. Shifting from pri- vate anguish to public outrage, they have also helped shift public opinion toward more support for abortion. \nIn the two years since the Su- preme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, their pain has been com- pounded into anger by new abor- tion bans across the country. While these women account for a fraction of abortions in the United States, they have emerged as the most powerful voices in the na- \nJim Cantrell worked with Mr. Musk at the founding of SpaceX in 2002. When he started to build his own launch company, Phantom Space, two potential customers told his sales team they could not sign deals because SpaceX inserts provisions in its contracts to dis- courage customers from using ri- vals. \nBut Mr. Perez — unenthusiastic about a Biden-Trump rematch, overwhelmed by the news and disillusioned by politics — is tun- ing out. \nMs. Walker is Catholic and had worked for Wyoming Republi- cans, including Senator John Bar- rasso. She opposed abortion, and  Continued on Page A14 \n“If you ask me right now what’s going on with, like, the presiden- tial race, or the situation in Gaza or Ukraine or whatever, I don’t think I can answer,” said Mr. Pe- rez, who supported Mr. Trump in 2020 and is intrigued by Robert F . Kennedy Jr. now. “I’m not trying to follow that anymore.” Instead, said Mr. Perez, a valet who hopes to become a firefighter, “I’m just going to have to roll with the punches, because I don’t think I’m going to make a difference.” In fact, people like him could be \n“After going through all this, I \n\nPeter Beck, an aerospace engi- neer from New Zealand, met in 2019 with Mr. Musk to talk about Mr. Beck’s own launch company, called  Rocket  Lab.  Several months later, SpaceX moved to start carrying small payloads at a discounted price that Mr. Beck and other industry executives said was intended to undercut their chances of success. \n“I don’t think this is an acciden- tal monopoly,” Mr. Beck said in an interview about SpaceX and Mr. Musk. “These are business deci- sions that are being made.” \nPolitically disengaged Ameri- cans are emerging as one of the most unpredictable, complex and potentially influential groups of voters in the 2024 race. They are fueling  Mr.  Trump’s  current polling leads but in many cases hail from traditionally Democratic backgrounds, giving Mr. Biden a chance to win some of them back — if he can get their attention. No shortage of events could jolt alienated voters over the next five months, starting with a verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president in American history, which could arrive this week. Even though many of these people are historically infrequent voters, those who do cast ballots could  \nNone of these executives said they had taken legal action against SpaceX. And no one in the industry disputes that Mr. Musk and SpaceX deserve enormous credit for making spaceflight more affordable and almost rou- tine. \nBut his tactics are generating a backlash within the industry.

Bromwich  and  Maggie Ha- berman . \nFor nearly three hours on Tues- day, Donald J. Trump’s lawyer did his level best to persuade the jury to acquit his client, wielding a scalpel to attack nearly every strand of the criminal case against the former president. \nThroughout a marathon closing argument that nearly outlasted daylight, the prosecutor delivered a sweeping rebuke of the former president, seeking to persuade the jury of 12 New Yorkers that Mr. Trump had falsified records to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star. The prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, wove together witness testimony and documents to drive home the key points of the weeks- long case, the first criminal trial of an American president. Facing the judge’s 8 p.m. dead- line, Mr. Steinglass raced to the wire, stopping only to take a gulp of water as the sky darkened out- side the towering courtroom win- dows. \n“Everything Mr. Trump and his cohorts did in this case was cloaked in lies,” Mr. Steinglass said as the jurors, who had been glued to most of his presentation, began to fidget in their seats. By the time the prosecutor fin- \nTrump arriving at court for closing arguments on Tuesday. \nto other business and the traffic on Lower Manhattan streets had slowed. More than 10 hours after Mr. Trump’s lawyer began the day by calling the case “absurd” and “preposterous,” Mr. Steinglass fi- nally had the final word. \nThe disparate strategies — Mr. Steinglass’s closing was more than twice as long as the defense’s — reflected their separate tasks. The defense needed only to estab- lish reasonable doubt, while the prosecution needed to persuade the jury to accept a narrative that, Mr. Steinglass argued, could lead to only one ending: guilty on all counts. \nThe closing arguments were each side’s last chance to pitch their case to the jury — and frame  Continued on Page A16 \n# \ncreated a school voucher program that, in the words of one speaker, let children “get a biblical world- view education.” Mr. Donalds addressed the group with characteristic humil- ity.
