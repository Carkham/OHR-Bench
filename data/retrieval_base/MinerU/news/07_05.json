The outcome could signal a new era in British politics. \nVowing to Steer Cash to Others as Rift Grows \nLANDSLIDE IN BRITAIN \nVote Reflects Anger With Economy, Health Care and Immigration \nThis article is by  Kenneth P . Vogel , Theodore Schleifer and  Lauren Hirsch . \nAfter several days of quiet grip- ing and hoping that President Bi- den would abandon his re-election campaign on his own, many wealthy Democratic donors are trying to take matters into their own hands. \n# \nLONDON — The Labour Party was projected to win a landslide election victory in Britain on Thursday, sweeping the Conser- vative Party out of power after 14 years in a thundering anti-incum- bent revolt that heralded a new era in British politics. \nWielding their fortunes as both carrot and stick, donors have un- dertaken a number of initiatives to pressure Mr. Biden to step down from the top of the ticket and help lay the groundwork for an al- ternate candidate. \nA nationwide exit poll con- ducted for the BBC and two other broadcasters indicated that La- bour was on course to win around 410 of the 650 seats in the British House of Commons, versus 131 for the Conservatives. \nThe efforts — some coordi- nated, some conflicting and others still nascent — expose a remark- able and growing rift between the party’s contributor class and its standard-bearer that could have an impact on down-ballot races, whether or not the donors influ- ence Mr. Biden’s decision. \nThat would give Labour almost as many seats as the record 418 it amassed in 1997, when Tony Blair’s runaway victory inaugu- rated the last era of Labour gov- ernment. \nThe president on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to stay in the race amid criticism of his weak debate performance last week. But that has not placated donors or strategists who worry that he cannot win in November. A group of them is working to raise as much as \\$100 million for a sort of escrow fund, called the Next Generation PAC, that would be used to support a replacement candidate. If Mr. Biden does not step aside, the money could be used to help down-ballot candi- dates, according to people close to the effort. \nIf the projections are con- firmed, it would be the worst de- feat for the Conservatives in the nearly 200-year history of the party, one that would raise search- ing questions about its future — and perhaps even its very sur- vival. \n# \nbelieved new progress in the talks amounted to what one repeatedly called   $\\mathrm{{}^{u}a}$   breakthrough” in the monthslong negotiations, though they said that it would take some time to work out the many steps involved in implementing the truce. Israeli and other officials in- volved in the talks agreed that there had been progress but de- scribed it in more cautious terms. The discussions are based on a three-stage framework deal publi- cized by President Biden in late May and endorsed by the United Nations. If carried out, the agree- \nA senior Biden administration official directly involved in the talks said that there is broad agreement now about the steps required to transition from phase one, a temporary cease-fire, to phase two, a permanent end to the fighting and a release of the re- maining living hostages. The official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitiv- ities of the negotiations, com- pared the current situation to the deal that was reached in Novem- Continued on Page A10 \n# \nThis article is by  Aaron Boxer- man ,  Michael D. Shear  and  Thomas Fuller . \nThe exit poll, which has accu- rately predicted the winner of the past five British general elections, confirmed a mutinous electorate, thoroughly fed up with the Con- servatives after a turbulent era that spanned austerity, Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the serial scan- dals of Prime Minister Boris John- son and the ill-fated tax-cutting proposals of his successor, Liz Truss. \nJERUSALEM — American and Israeli officials on Thursday ex- pressed renewed optimism over a cease-fire deal in the Gaza Strip, after Hamas revised its position and Prime Minister Benjamin Ne- tanyahu of Israel then told Presi- dent Biden that he was sending a new delegation of negotiators to the stalled talks. \nment would ultimately stipulate an end to the war, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and for Hamas and its allies to release the remaining 120 living and dead hostages in Gaza for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. \nSupporters of potential replace- Continued on Page A14 \nGOVERNORS  The president re- assured leaders of his fitness, despite a tiring schedule.

Behind him, a drone followed, as a col- league tracked the movements from a briefcase-size computer. \nIf the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his col- leagues hadn’t disengaged the au- tonomous tracking, Mr. Babenko would have been a goner. \nVyriy is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weap- onization of consumer technology, driven by the war with Russia. The pressure to outthink the ene- my, along with huge flows of in- vestment, donations and govern- ment  contracts,  has  turned Ukraine into a Silicon Valley for autonomous drones and other weaponry. \nUntil recently, a human would have piloted the quadcopter. No longer. Instead, after the drone locked onto its target — Mr. Babenko — it flew itself, guided by software that used the machine’s camera to track him. \n# \nPARIS — In the 1980s, a French punk rock band coined a rallying cry against the country’s far right that retained its punch over dec- ades. The chant, still shouted at protests by the left, is   $^\\mathrm{sc}\\mathrm{La}$   je- unesse emmerde le Front Na- tional,” which cannot be translat- ed well without curse words, but essentially tells the far right to get lost. \nThe motorcycle’s growling en- gine was no match for the silent drone as it stalked Mr. Babenko. “Push, push more. Pedal to the metal, man,” his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the \n# \nDressed for excess, Julie and Garrett Brown, and Dorsett, took in the Nathan’s contest.

Now, that notion has been challenged as increasing num- bers of young people have joined swaths of the French electorate to support the National Rally, a party once deemed too extreme to gov- ern. \nthe schoolyard video is the sub- ject of debate in China right now. Last month, a Chinese man stabbed a Japanese mother and her son in eastern China. Two weeks earlier, four visiting in- structors from a college in Iowa were stabbed in northeastern China. Some in China are ques- tioning the role that online speech plays in inciting real- world violence. \nThe video posted last year on Chinese social media showed more than 100 Japanese children, supposedly at an elementary school in Shanghai, gathered in their schoolyard.

And the stu- dents were not stoking hatred of China; they were swearing an oath to play fair at what looked like a sporting event.
