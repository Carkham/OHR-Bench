It wasn’t the only time Mr. Trump was talked out of using the military for domestic law enforce- ment — a practice that would carry profound implications for civil liberties and for the tradi- tional  constraints  on  federal power. He repeatedly raised the idea of using troops to secure bor- der states, and even proposed shooting both violent protesters and undocumented migrants in the legs, former aides have said. In his first term in office, Mr. Trump never realized his expan- sive vision of using troops to en- force the law on U.S. soil. But as he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of do- mestic law enforcement pur- poses, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cit- ies run by Democrats. “In places where there is a true breakdown of the rule of law, such as the most dangerous neighbor- hoods in Chicago, the next presi- dent should use every power at his disposal to restore order — and, if necessary, that includes sending in the National Guard or the troops,” Mr. Trump said at a conservative conference in Dallas in August 2022, shortly before an- nouncing that he was running to be that next president. During his time out of power, al- lies of Mr. Trump have worked on \nThe new polls from The New York Times and Siena College show how quickly Ms. Harris has reshaped the terrain of 2024 and thrust the Sun Belt back to the center of the battleground-state map. \nMs. Harris is now leading Mr. Trump among likely voters in Ari- zona, 50 percent to 45 percent, and has even edged ahead of Mr. Trump in North Carolina — a state Mr. Trump won four years ago — while narrowing his lead signifi- cantly in Georgia and Nevada.

She did not want to just give a speech without sub- stance. And she had spent much of the previous year and a half trying to avoid being typecast as the first female vice president. But as the White House began mapping out executive actions to defend access to abortion, she began to see the possibilities and accepted the role. It was a moment that captured the essence of the Harris vice presidency. Deliberate and disci- plined, cautious and at times risk averse, she saw trapdoors around her and wanted to avoid them. She considered herself a team player, but could not always be sure the \ntake the lead, one that Mr. Biden, a churchgoing Catholic, did not feel as comfortable addressing. She found her voice as the administra- tion’s champion of abortion rights, changing some minds among Democrats who had harbored doubts about her. And she paved the way to the moment when she will accept her party’s nomination for president this week. \n# \n# \nand ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS WASHINGTON — When a draft of a blockbuster Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v.
