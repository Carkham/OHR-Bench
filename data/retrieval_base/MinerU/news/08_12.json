In pledging their support, many offered emo- tional testimonies about the per- sonal relationships they have built with her. \nA newly minted college gradu- ate from small-town Nebraska, he had just turned down a stable, 9- to-5 job offer and moved across the world to teach at a local high school in China. He had made it as far as Hong Kong, just across the Chinese border, when People’s Liberation Army tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square to crush pro- democracy protests. \nBut it was not long before the men confronted the elephant in the room. \nRumors were flying about a possible civil war in China. Many foreigners, including most Ameri- can teachers, had fled the country. Should he go back home or contin- ue his journey into China? \n“Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men,” said Kwame Raoul, the attorney gen- eral of Illinois. “I’m here to tell you all tonight that it does the opposite of that — it displays strength.” Mr. Raoul then drove home his point. “I’m standing behind a \nA Glimmering Goodbye The Paris Olympics ended with a grandiose closing ceremony on Sunday.

The United Nations General Assem- bly, that other grand global en- deavor, excludes the territories, the itty-bitty islands and the not- quite nations that get to go to the Games. Puerto Rico, Palestine, Chinese  Taipei  —  they  all marched in the Olympic parade of nations, as did a refugee team whose 37 members were forcibly displaced from some of the very countries that competed along- side them in Paris. \nBlack woman to be president of the United States, and it doesn’t make me any less of a Black man,” he said. “I’m asking all of you all to do the same.” \nPARIS — The athletes had lost. Their time in Paris was over. And they were, in this moment of de- feat by a team from a political ri- val, not even allowed the comfort of their homeland’s name and flag. To be an Olympian from Taiwan is to not exist, at least not officially. To placate China, the island com- petes at the Games under the awkward designation of Chinese Taipei. The intrusion of politics into sports forces the island’s ath- letes to engage in the kind of rhet- orical gymnastics that might trip up a champion tumbler, and which bring a particular sting when you \n\n# \nPARIS — After learning that she might lose the bronze medal she won in the floor exercise at the Paris Olympics — the only indi- vidual medal she won at these Summer Games — the American gymnast Jordan Chiles took to so- cial media on Saturday and posted four broken heart emojis on a black background. \nThe call, one in a series the Har- ris campaign has held in recent weeks with Black women, white women and white “dudes,” was a rallying cry to a part of a crucial Democratic constituency seen as skeptical of Ms. Harris. \nare a table tennis player who has just been beaten by Team China. “I’m only fighting for myself, through my own hard work,” said Taiwan’s Chen Szu-yu, substitut- ing self for state on the Olympic stage. \nHer teammate Chien Tung- chuan sidestepped the political discussion  entirely,  refraining from comment on Taiwan’s status at the Olympics. \nThat’s four broken hearts for the four seconds that cost her a bronze medal. Four seconds over which she had no control. \nBut to accommodate such a di- versity — North Korea and South  Continued on Page A5 \nGov. Tim Walz taught in China for a year when he was 25. \nThe  International  Olympic Committee confirmed on Sunday that it would strip Chiles of her bronze medal and give it to Roma- nia’s Ana Barbosu. The decision came after the Court of Arbitra- tion for Sport ruled on Saturday that Chiles’s coach had filed a scoring inquiry four seconds too late, according to gymnastics rules. \nSquare crackdown. “The opportu- nity to be in a Chinese high school at that critical time seemed to me to be really important.” \n\nHarris to victory in November. Dr. Moya Bailey, a Northwest- ern University professor who coined the term “misogynoir” to describe racist misogyny, said in an interview that while patriarchy is not unique to the Black popula- tion, “the consequences are much higher.” Scholars note that a dem- ographic group that is conserva- tive on many social issues has his- torically equated leadership with masculinity, borne out in the dearth of Black female leaders in the church, business and elected office. \nThe one year that Mr. Walz spent teaching English in south- ern China was the start of what would become a decades-long re- lationship with the country. As high school teachers in Nebraska and Minnesota, Mr. Walz and his wife, Gwen, regularly led trips to China in the 1990s and early 2000s to introduce students to China’s history and culture. Mr. Walz has said that he has traveled to China some 30 times, including for his honeymoon. \nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said Sun- day that it would appeal the reallo- cation of Chiles’s medal, and by Sunday afternoon, U.S.A. Gym- nastics, the sport’s governing body in America, had begun that fight. \nThat deep history of engage- ment with China reflects a lesser- Continued on Page A13 \nIn a statement posted on its so- cial media accounts, U.S.A. Gym- nastics said it had filed a letter and video evidence that it said showed “conclusively” that the U.S. coach- ing staff had requested an inquiry 47 seconds after Chiles’s final score was posted — well within the limit, it argued, that is imposed by the sport’s rules. \nWhen Shirley Chisholm, the  Continued on Page A15 \n# \nChiles, who had helped the United States win the gold medal in the team event in Paris, and whose bronze in the floor com- pleted the first all-Black podium in Olympic women’s gymnastics his- tory, was subjected to racist abuse online after the judges’ initial deci- sion to raise her score. That abuse and the stripping of her medal cast a shadow on the closing day of what had otherwise been a highly regarded Games. \n# \n# \nwrote about the party that her husband’s speech “made me cry by the end with his authentic, raw emotion and romantic words.” It all culminated in the kind of envy-inducing images anticipated by the roughly 80,000 followers of “Mama and Tata,” Ms. Miller’s In- stagram feed, which featured a near-constant stream of photo- graphs and videos of her glittering life. \nIn the modern Gilded Age of New York, where Instagram is awash in unrestrained displays of wealth, Brandon and Candice Miller were royalty. At their 10th wedding anniver- sary  “Midsummer  Night’s Dream” party, they celebrated with a few dozen friends in the backyard of their 5,500-square- foot vacation home in the Hamp- tons. \nAs the war grinds on in Ukraine, summer camps have taken on a more patriotic tone.
