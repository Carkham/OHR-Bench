Shear ,  Katie Rogers  and  Adam En- tous . \nMorale Surges for Kyiv’s Military as Moscow \nBut by that Saturday evening, something had shifted. \nWASHINGTON — In the end, he was alone. \nIt was not just about the polls, people close to Mr. Biden say. De- spite everything, Mr. Biden be- lieved he could still claim the Democratic nomination and beat former  President  Donald  J. Trump. Aides say that he still be- lieves that. \n\nConfined to a spare bedroom in his vacation home and fighting off bouts of coughing from Covid, President Biden was exhausted when he turned in for the night on Saturday, July 20. Whether he slept soundly or fitfully or not at all, people close to him said he took the long hours by himself to mull over the historic decision he was about to make. \n# \nWASHINGTON — Ukraine’s incursion into a sliver of Russia is likely to make it harder for Mos- cow to mount a major renewed of- fensive in Ukraine’s east and is the kind of surprise operation that could eventually impose real costs on the Kremlin, according to U.S. officials. \nWhat began to change the pres- ident’s mind, people familiar with his thinking say, was the realiza- tion that if he stayed in the race, he was in for a lonely battle that would rip apart the Democratic Party, the cause he had served nearly his entire life. Would a man who views himself as the ultimate consensus builder in Washington want to wage an intraparty war that would run counter to the fab- ric of who he is? \nHe had just been through a bru- tal two days in Rehoboth Beach, Del., as he huddled with his wife, Jill Biden, and his closest aides, who rotated from a screened-in porch to a sitting area off the din- ing room. \n\n\nThe Ukrainian strike, and its continued success, could ulti- mately have strategic signifi- cance, though U.S. officials cau- tion that they will need to see how it plays out to draw firmer conclu- sions. It could also help rebuild sagging morale among Ukraine’s troops and war-weary population, the officials said. \nSteve Ricchetti, the president’s eyes and ears on Capitol Hill, and Mike Donilon, his chief strategist, had shared internal polling with the president that Saturday that mirrored what Americans had been seeing for weeks: Mr. Biden was falling behind, nationally and in key battleground states. There was still a path to victory, they advised him, but the fight would be ugly. The president would be pitted against his do- nors, half of his party in Congress and Democratic voters who had concluded that he was too old to \nquestion. \nBiden asked his two advisers, “what would we say?” A  statement  was  drafted, known only to four other people: the first lady and her closest aide, Anthony Bernal; the president’s son Hunter; and Annie Tomasini, the gatekeeper at the White House and the president’s deputy chief of staff. \nThe incursion, into the Kursk region of Russia, stands in stark contrast to Ukraine’s failed coun- teroffensive in southern Ukraine last summer. This offensive was developed in secret, devised to di- vert Russian troops away from the front lines in Ukraine and seize territory to use as a bargain- ing chip. \nMore than 200 people on Thitu Island, part of a contested section of the South China Sea, find themselves on the frontier of a possible conflict with China. Top, children play near an old fortifica- tion on Thitu; an off-duty soldier with binoculars; and Chinese ships in the Spratly archipelago. \nUkraine’s monthslong buildup to the counter offensive played out in the open. The Ukrainians had sought to retake territory but stumbled when they failed to punch through dug-in Russian de- fenses, which Moscow reinforced as Ukraine trained for the drive. Ukraine also split its forces during that offensive, against American advice, rather than focusing them as they have this month. But the incursion into Russia shows how Ukraine’s army has improved its mechanized warfare skills, techniques that it failed to master a year ago. \n $\\operatorname{At}9\\,\\mathrm{p.m}$  . that evening, the pres- ident excused himself. It was time to call it a night. \nFor more than three weeks, Mr. Biden had insisted he would stay in the race.

These civilians are the only ones in the Spratly Islands — a chain of 100 or so atolls, reefs and cays in the South China Sea that may have significant oil reserves and is claimed by six countries. And they find them- selves in the middle of a tense geopolitical dispute. Marjorie Ganizo and her hus- band, Junie Antonio Ganizo, moved here with their eight children in November despite what they saw as the risk of a Chinese invasion. “In the end, we had to ask ourselves: hunger or fear?” Ms. Ganizo, 36, said. “No matter where you are, if it’s your time to die, it’s your time to die.” Tensions have flared between  Continued on Page A6 \n# \n# \nTHITU, Spratly Islands — For travelers flying into the tiny island of Thitu, the reality of China’s territorial ambition be- comes instantly clear. There they are: dozens of Chinese ships surrounding a speck of land that a few hundred Filipinos call home. \n# \nthat Thitu is contested land. Nearby, China has stationed a flotilla of coast guard ships and maritime militia vessels. On a neighboring reef, it has con- structed a military base whose lights shimmer at night like a city. The intensifying Chinese presence has startled the Phil- ippines, which has occupied Thitu for nearly half a century. So it is upgrading its crumbling military facilities that lie on the island’s southern end. And it is encouraging more Filipinos to move in, betting more residents will strengthen \nFor now though, life is mostly peaceful and slow on the island.

On a recent evening, a few people gathered near the beach to debone fish, while others waded into tide pools with fishing spears.

After a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., he went on the offensive. Mr. Walz wrote an opinion piece asserting that he had “repeatedly voted in favor” of tougher back- ground checks, federal gun vio- lence research and firearm bans for people on no-fly lists. He had “voted for universal background checks more than anybody in this race,” he told an interviewer. And he posted a video in which he said he had voted “dozens of times” in Congress for stronger gun laws. Gun advocates, however, had never questioned his loyalty as a legislator. The N.R.A. kept giving him high marks until he ran for governor, and Guns & Ammo mag- azine in 2016 named him one of its \nWASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday un- veiled the results of landmark drug price negotiations between Medicare  and  pharmaceutical companies, allowing President Bi- den and Vice President Kamala Harris to cast themselves as con- fronting the drug industry on be- half of older Americans at a criti- cal moment in the presidential campaign. \nColumbia University students and faculty confronted a tangle of emotions on Thursday morning after the sudden departure of the school’s president, Nemat Shafik. Some protesters and politicians who had harried her for months celebrated and claimed victory. Other students and faculty mem- bers contemplating her departure were saddened. But there was also cautious optimism that the \n# \nyearly out-of-pocket drug costs, will do more to save older Ameri- cans money at the pharmacy counter. \nThe 10 drugs subject to negotia- tions include widely used blood thinners and arthritis medica- tions. Had the new prices been in effect last year, administration of- ficials said, Medicare would have saved \\$6 billion, which would have reduced its spending on those drugs by 22 percent. \nThe negotiated prices, which take effect in 2026, are expected to save billions of dollars for Medi- care, which is funded by taxpay- ers.
