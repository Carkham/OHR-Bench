The “lucky” fam- ilies were those whose loved ones’ remains were retrieved by soldiers, at great risk, and brought home to Israel for burial. So the audacious rescue on Saturday of four living hostages instantly raised morale in Israel and offered at least a momentary victory for the country’s embat- tled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \n# \n“It doesn’t solve the problem in the north; it doesn’t solve the problem in Gaza; and it doesn’t solve the slew of other problems that threaten Israel in the inter- national arena,” he added. The decision on Sunday of Benny Gantz, a former military chief and Mr. Netanyahu’s main political rival, to pull his centrist National Unity party out of the emergency wartime cabinet left Mr. Netanyahu even more ex- posed. \nWILMINGTON, Del. — One by one, the women drifted into the courthouse: The wife. The ex-wife. The daughter. The sis- ter-in-law who, through the fog of tragedy and drug abuse, ended up an ex-girlfriend. \nOnce inside the courtroom, they locked their eyes past the many strangers who watched them — people who wondered if they would break down, or say the wrong thing. If they would cry. \nBut by Sunday, euphoria was already giving way to a harsher reality. The heavy air and ground assault that accompanied the rescue killed scores of Palestin- ians, including civilians, accord- ing to Gaza health officials, punc- turing Israel’s claims that the operation was a resounding success, at least internationally. And the operation failed to re- solve any of the deep dilemmas and challenges vexing the Israeli government, according to ana- lysts. \nThe stability of Mr. Netanya- hu’s government now appears to be hanging in the balance. \nHunter Biden is the one on criminal trial, staring down gun charges. But the spectacle in the courtroom has forced the Biden women into an uncomfortable spotlight. \nBenny Gantz quit Israel’s emergency government. \nIn the family, public life has often revolved around the men. The women called to testify had, at different points, tried to sup- port and protect the one who was the troubled husband, father and son — and whose ruinous history of addiction continues to hit them with shrapnel. The women who didn’t speak sat in the court- room, playing parts of nurturers \nEight months into its grinding war in Gaza, Israel still appears to be far from achieving its stated objectives of dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. And Israelis fear that time is running out for many of the hostages in Gaza. About a third of the 120 that remain have already been declared dead by Israeli authorities. \nThe pain of this responsibility was written on the face of Hunt- er Biden’s eldest daughter, Na- omi Biden Neal, who testified on his behalf on Friday. \nPressure has been building on the Israeli government to reach a deal with Hamas for the release of all the remaining hostages. But the fate of Israel’s proposal for a truce and a hostage and prisoner swap, as outlined by President Biden more than a week ago, is still uncertain. The Biden administration and Israeli officials say they are still await- ing a formal response from Ha- mas to determine whether nego- tiations can resume. Israelis are now debating whether the hostage rescue operation will help or hinder the prospects for such a deal — one  Continued on Page A8 \nAt the same time, Israel’s leadership is grappling with an escalation of hostilities across the northern border with Leba- non and battling increasing international isolation and oppro- brium over the war in Gaza, including allegations of genocide that are being heard by the Inter- national Court of Justice in The Hague. \nFriday. “He seemed hopeful.” Ms. Biden Neal, 30, was de- scribing a period in October 2018 when drug addiction was again overtaking her father’s life. That month, Hunter Biden had bought a gun and filled out a federal form attesting that he was not using drugs — a decision that is at the heart of the prosecution’s case against him. \nThe rescue mission “doesn’t solve a single one of the prob- lems that Israel has been facing ever since Oct. 7,” Nahum Barnea, a leading Israeli political columnist, wrote in the popular \nMs. Biden Neal had to revisit  Continued on Page A13 \n# \n# \n# \nSAN JUAN, P .R. — Feral cats have roamed the blue cobble- stone streets of Old San Juan for as long as anyone can remember. They meander around a historic fortress that looms \nPuerto Rico, a United States territory plagued by financial troubles and natural disasters, has bigger things to worry about. But the plan to remove close to 200 cats from Old San Juan — a neighborhood of San Juan that was the first place on the island settled by the Spanish — has struck an emotional chord at a time when many Puerto Ricans feel like they, too, are in danger of being pushed from their homes. \n# \nTran Dang sued the makers of the Netflix dating series “Love Is Blind” over allegations of “false imprisonment,” saying it confined her and the rest of the cast to hotel rooms without their phones. She also accused a fellow cast member of groping her and exposing him- self. \nSan Juaneros feed them. Tour- ists snap their pictures. But probably not for much longer: The federal agency that manages the fortress and the land around it wants the cats gone, saying that they are a nuisance and could be carrying disease. \nBravo’s “Real Housewives” uni- verse has inspired a string of law- suits, as the drama and battles have moved from TV screens to social media to tabloids to court dockets. Caroline Manzo, who had signed on to appear in a spinoff, accused the companies behind the show of failing to intervene when a co-star forcibly groped and kissed her during filming, and charged that they “regularly ply the Real Housewives cast with al- cohol, cause them to become se- verely intoxicated” and then en- courage or allow them to “sexu- \n# \nThe reasons differ — for the people, it is investors snapping up properties and pushing up  Continued on Page A16 \n# \nA federal plan to remove feral cats hits close to home for locals. \nKHERSON CITY, Ukraine — As news of Rus- sia’s invasion spread through Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Dr. Natalia Lukina was waiting for a taxi at her home. \nmoved from troubled homes or abandoned. “Who else would have stayed behind to look af- ter them?” Dr. Lukina said about her decision to remain with the children. “Imagine if we all turned our backs and left?” \nIt was 6 a.m., and she was eager to get to work at Kherson Children’s Home, a state-run foster home for institutionalized children with special \nOlena Korniyenko, the director of the foster home and the children’s legal guardian, had pre- pared emergency bags for the children two weeks earlier, and she had stocked the home with boxes of food, water and diapers. \nally harass other cast members because that is good for ratings.” And Faith Stowers, a former member of the cast of “Vander- pump Rules,” a spinoff of “The Real  Housewives  of  Beverly Hills,” sued the companies behind the show, claiming that after she had reported instances of racism, harassment and another cast member brandishing a knife at  Continued on Page A15 \nBy the time she arrived, the rumble of artillery fired by Russian troops advancing on Kherson City, the region’s capital, was already reverberat- ing through the hallways. The doctor and her fel- low caregivers faced a wrenching dilemma: how to protect the dozens of vulnerable children. They were all infants and toddlers, and some had serious disabilities, such as cerebral palsy. Some had living parents who retained limited custody over them, while others had been re- \nBut the building was not equipped to withstand gunfire or shelling, and the police had already fled the city.
