When Mr. Biden arrives in France for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, it will be his first time in Europe since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack led by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and brought a military retaliation that has killed about 36,000 people in Gaza. Next week, he will return to Europe for a summit in Italy with the leaders of the Group of 7 nations, and three weeks after that he will host the 75th anniver- sary summit of NATO nations in Washington.\n\n \n“The simple truth is, there is a worldwide migrant crisis,” Mr. Biden said at the White House, “and if the United States doesn’t secure our border, there’s no limit to the number of people who may try to come here.” Mr. Biden’s announcement is a stunning reversal for a president and a party that spent years arguing that America was a country of immigrants. When President Barack Obama wanted to shore up his chances of re- election in 2012, he issued a sweeping executive order on immigration — one that allowed millions of immigrants to stay in the country legally. \n# \n# \nAs the results came into view, the  country’s  stock  markets plunged.

NEW DELHI — Suddenly, the aura  of  invincibility  around Narendra Modi has been shat- tered. \nThe series of meetings will put Mr. Biden in a position he has not experienced since becoming pres- ident: He will be embraced and isolated at the same time by the group of allies he has courted for nearly four years. For a president who has emphasized his support for America’s traditional alli- ances, it represents a challenge that will test his diplomatic skills in unfamiliar ways. \n# \nA dozen years later, with the number of people crossing the border illegally at historic highs, \nWASHINGTON — House Dem- ocrats on Tuesday went on the of- fensive on reproductive rights, an- nouncing they will seek to force a vote on legislation to codify the right to birth control access na- tionwide. \nmark in Parliament. It is a feat that only one other Indian leader has  accomplished,  and  his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P ., gained far more seats than any other party. \nIn an Indian election in which his party’s slogan had promised a landslide victory and Mr. Modi even repeatedly referred to him- self as sent by God, the results an- nounced on Tuesday were unex- pectedly sobering. \n\nMr. Modi took a more positive view in a statement on X declaring that his coalition had won a third term. “This is a historical feat in India’s history,” he said. “We will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people.” For Mr. Modi, a generous read- ing of the outcome could be that  Continued on Page A8 \n“Gaza undermines the moral clarity of the argument they want to make about Ukraine,” said Pe- ter Beinart, a professor of journal- ism and politics at the City Univer- sity of New York and a longtime analyst of Middle East affairs who has been critical of Israel’s gov- ernment. “The Gaza war makes that story a lot less compelling to a lot of people.” \nBut instead of a runaway win, the B.J.P . lost dozens of seats. It now finds itself at the mercy of its coalition partners — including one politician notorious for how often he has switched sides — to stay in power, a sharp reversal a decade into Mr. Modi’s transformation al tenure. \nThe maneuver, through a pro- cedural move known as a dis- charge petition, is all but certain to fail for lack of Republican support, but that is by design. It is part of a broad election-year push by Dem- ocrats to highlight Republicans’ record of opposing abortion rights and other reproductive health choices that voters fear will be stripped away following the fall of Roe v. Wade. \nMr. Modi, 73, is set to take up a third consecutive term as prime minister, after the Election Com- mission gave final confirmation early Wednesday that the parties that make up his coalition had col- lectively passed the majority \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India will need to rely on his coalition partners to stay in power. \nThe Mexican National Guard near the border with Texas. \nIvo Daalder, who was an ambas- sador to NATO under President Barack Obama, acknowledged the tension in Mr. Biden’s approach. “Yes, it seems to be slightly con- tradictory to be making one argu- ment on Russia and another argu- ment on Israel,” said Mr. Daalder, who now serves as president of the Chicago Council on Global Af- fairs. “But the situations are dif- ferent. One was attacked, and the other did the attacking. It’s pretty big.” \n“The choice to use birth control should be yours and yours alone,” Representative  Katherine  M. Clark of Massachusetts, the Dem- ocratic whip, who has held abor- tion events with 11 members and candidates across the country, said at a news conference outside the Capitol. House Republicans, she said, “can put aside their MAGA ideology, join us, join the American people and get this bill passed. Or they can triple down on their anti-freedom extremism in \nthe next Democratic president moved entirely in the other direc- tion. Critics say Mr. Biden is adopting the tactics of Mr. Trump and Stephen Miller, his immigra- tion czar, to end asylum, even using the same clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act that Mr. Trump cited to justify a \n“Stephen Miller and Donald Trump peddled fear-based poli- tics on immigration, and the Biden White House has decided to buy,” said Heidi Altman, the policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center. She called it “a dangerous shift” that will “put the United States at odds with core values and com- mitments.” \nThe European allies, with a cou- ple of notable exceptions, have been strongly aligned with Wash- ington for more than two years in the multinational campaign to de- feat Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, broadly matching Amer- ican investments in the war with their own commitments to Kyiv. But the Europeans have grown in- creasingly critical of how Israel is conducting its operation in Gaza over the past nine months, even as the Biden administration has re- jected efforts by the chief prosecu- tor at the International Criminal  Continued on Page A5 \nThe move comes as Senate Democrats plan to force a vote this week on an identical contra- ceptive access bill, which Republi- cans are expected to block. The coordinated  legislative  push shows that Democrats regard ac- cess to abortion, contraception and reproductive health options as their strongest issues on which to draw a contrast with Republi- cans before the November elec- tions. \nContinued on Page A14 \nARIZONA  Republicans have added a tough immigration measure to November’s ballot.
