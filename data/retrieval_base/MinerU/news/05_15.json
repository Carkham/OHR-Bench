Now, after months of Russian ground advances and technolog- ical leaps in countering American- provided arms, the Biden admin- istration is increasingly con- cerned that President Vladimir V. Putin has enough momentum to change the trajectory of the war, and perhaps reverse his once- bleak prospects. \n# \nJERUSALEM — With Israeli troops returning to clear Hamas for the second or third time from parts of northern Gaza, and fight- ing farther south in Rafah, too, Is- rael’s government has found itself confronting more vocal discontent from an important constituency: its own military leaders. \nCurrent and former senior mili- tary officers have begun to argue more openly that because the gov- ernment has failed to roll out a plan for what follows the fighting in Gaza, Israeli troops are being forced — in the eighth month of the war — to battle again for areas of the territory where Hamas fighters have reappeared. \nArtillery and drones provided by the United States and NATO have been taken out by Russian electronic warfare techniques, which came to the battlefield late but have proved surprisingly ef- fective. And a monthslong debate in Washington about whether to send Ukraine a \\$61 billion pack- age of arms and ammunition cre- ated an opening that Russia has clearly exploited, even though Congress ultimately passed the legislation. \nTwo Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional repercussions, said some generals and members of the war cabinet were especially frustrated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to develop and announce a process for building an alternative to Ha- mas to govern Gaza. \n# \n# \ningly low share of the vote for an incumbent president. The series of polls focused on what are ex- pected to be the most contested states this fall: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n# \n# \nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling stronger than any third-party can- didate has in decades, pulling in roughly 10 percent of registered voters across the battleground states as he saps support from both President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, a new series of polls has found. The overall results in the Biden versus Trump contest were virtu- ally unchanged when Mr. Ken- nedy was included in the polls conducted by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer. But be- neath the surface of that seeming stability, the surveys revealed \nThere was little expectation, among officials or experts, that a new government would be formed while combat raged. But “clear, hold and build” is the widely ac- cepted practice for fighting an in- surgency. And to a growing num- ber of critics, Israel appears to be simply stuck in clearing mode, in- creasing the risks for Israeli sol- diers and Gazan civilians while cease-fire talks remain stalemat- ed. \nThis article is by  Ben Protess ,  Jo- nah E. Bromwich  and  Maggie Ha- berman . \nTwo of the groups that Mr. Ken- nedy performed strongest with in the surveys — voters under 30 (18 percent support) and Latinos (14 percent) — have traditionally been strong Democratic constitu- encies, unnerving some party strategists.

Trump’s presidency, he and his personal lawyer met in the Oval Office for a private conversa- tion about money. \n“I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was OK,” the lawyer, Michael D.

American and allied officials in- terviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity, in or- der to discuss intelligence reports and sensitive battlefield assess- ments. But some of the concerns have spilled out in public com- ments. \nWhen monthly checks started arriving — most bearing Mr. Trump’s signature — they dis- guised the nature of the pay- ments, Mr. Cohen testified. The stubs described the checks as part of a legal “retainer” agreement, but they were in fact reimburse- ments for hush money that Mr. Co- hen had paid to silence a porn star’s story of sex with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump was present when a plan to fic- tionalize the records was cooked up weeks earlier in New York. \n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken said with some under- statement on Sunday that “there’s Continued on Page A7 \nIsrael over the war has focused on  Continued on Page A10 \n# \n# \nThe testimony marked a pivotal moment for prosecutors. They charged Mr. Trump with falsifying the checks and other records, and Mr. Cohen’s recounting drove those accusations home. It offered the jury its first and only personal account tying the former presi- dent to the documents at the crux of his case. \n\n# \nAlice Munro, the revered Cana- dian author who started writing short stories because she did not think she had the time or the tal- ent to master novels, then stub- bornly dedicated her long career to churning out psychologically dense stories that dazzled the lit- erary world and earned her the Nobel Prize in Literature, died on Monday night in Port Hope, On- tario, east of Toronto. She was 92. A spokesman for her publisher, Penguin Random House Canada, confirmed the death, at a nursing home. Ms. Munro’s health had de- clined since at least 2009, when she said she’d had heart bypass surgery and had been treated for cancer, though she continued to write. \nMr. Trump has denied the alle- gations and the sex, and his legal team soon sought to sweep Mr. Co- hen’s revelations aside in cross- examination.
