All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive details about the assassination. \nThe bomb had been hidden ap- proximately two months ago in the guesthouse, according to five of the Middle Eastern officials. The guesthouse is run and pro- tected by the Islamic Revolution- ary Guards Corps and is part of a large compound, known as Ne- shat, in an upscale neighborhood of northern Tehran. \nIranian officials and Hamas said Wednesday that Israel was responsible for the assassination, an assessment also reached by several U.S. officials who re- quested anonymity. The assassi- nation threatened to unleash an- other wave of violence in the Mid- dle East and upend the ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza. Mr. Haniyeh had been a top negotiator in the cease-fire talks. Israel has not publicly acknowl- edged  responsibility  for  the killing, but Israeli intelligence offi- cials briefed the United States and other Western governments on the details of the operation in the immediate aftermath, according to the five Middle Eastern offi- cials. \nMr. Haniyeh was in Iran’s capi- tal for the presidential inaugura- tion. The bomb was detonated re- motely, the five officials said, once it was confirmed that he was in- side his room at the guesthouse. The blast also killed a bodyguard. The explosion shook the build- ing, shattered some windows and caused the partial collapse of an exterior wall, according to the two Iranian officials, members of the \nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that the United States had received no advance knowledge of the assassi- \n\nnation plot. In the hours after the killing, speculation immediately focused on the possibility that Israel had killed Mr. Haniyeh with a missile strike, possibly fired from a drone or a plane, similar to how Israel had launched a missile on a mili- tary base in Isfahan in April. That missile theory raised questions about how Israel might have been able to evade Iranian air defense systems again to exe- cute such a brazen airstrike in the capital. \n# \nOval Office,” he said, and he wished them “welcome almost home.” \n\n# \nThe exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, and involved seven planes ferrying the 24 pris- oners from the United States, Ger- many, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia, according to the Turk- ish government, which has posi- tioned itself as a mediator be- tween Moscow and the United States throughout the war in Ukraine. \nBERLIN — A prisoner swap on Thursday among seven countries freed the Wall Street Journal re- porter Evan Gershkovich and two other Americans held in Russia, along with several jailed Russian dissidents, in a deal whose size and complexity has no parallel in \nA photograph provided to The New York Times shows dam- age to a guesthouse in Tehran. \nContinued on Page A6 \n# \nthe post-Soviet era.

Trump questioned Vice Presi- dent Kamala Harris’s racial iden- tity on Wednesday, he lifted a longstanding and false line of at- tack from the fringes of political discourse to the very center of a presidential campaign. \nWASHINGTON — After a week of oversights and failures, the offi- cers protecting former President Donald J. Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., still had one \n\n# \nlast chance to get it right. The chance lasted about 30 seconds. It began when a local police offi- cer peered over the roof of the AGR International warehouse near the rally grounds and found the suspicious man he and other officers were hunting. Ninety minutes of confusion about Thom- as Crooks’s intentions and where- abouts had ended in an instant. “Long gun!” the officer broad- cast over the local law enforce- ment radio system, according to congressional testimony from the \nFor years, rivals and critics have lodged accusations that Ms. Harris shifts her personal identity to her political advantage, and that she is, in fact, not who she claims to be. Those attacks, based on falsehoods, misinformation and conspiratorial notions, have increased dramatically in the week and a half since she emerged as  Democrats’  all-but-certain \n# \n# \nIn a world that seems con- sumed by the trials of capitalism and the unyielding pressure to work, Robin Leach, the British television personality who died in 2018, noted one place that did it differently: In Italy, Mr. Leach said, they add work and life onto food and wine. \nJust hours after President Bi- den announced that he would not seek a second term, the right- wing agitator Laura Loomer posted on the social media site X that Ms. Harris “pretends to be black” as part of what she called a “delusional,  Democrat  DEI quota.” \nIt was urgent news that should have instantly traveled to a com- mand center shared by the local police and the Secret Service, and then to agents close enough to throw their bodies in front of Mr. Trump. They still had time to dis- rupt an assassination attempt. \nLuciano Fregonese, the mayor of Valdobbiadene — a rural town of 10,000 people in Italy’s pictur- esque northeast, famous for its Prosecco — has lived such truths. “It’s not easy, because every weekend there is one or two or three or maybe more events to at- tend to, and every event it is com- mon to drink wine, or Prosecco, and also to eat,” the mayor said in an interview, with the help of a translator. “It’s not easy to say ‘no.’” \nThe next day, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who spoke at the Republican National Convention last month, said on his popular interview show that the vice president was “sort of Black, sort of Indian.” The rapper Lil Pump, a Trump supporter who has some 20 million followers across Instagram, TikTok and X, said on Sunday that “Kamala Har- ris isn’t even black . . . she’s Indi- an.”\nBut the radio message never got to the Secret Service, and 30 seconds later Mr. Crooks un- leashed his first shots. \nThat dropped communication was one of several instances where technologies that might have protected Mr. Trump from getting shot on July 13 did not — either because they malfunc- tioned, were improperly deployed or the Secret Service decided not to use them in the first place.
