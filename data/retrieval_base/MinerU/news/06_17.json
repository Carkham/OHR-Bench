The soldier survived and was evacuated to Rostov in Russia. \n# \nPrioritizing Aid to U.S., Fighting to the Israelis \n# \nJERUSALEM — The an- nouncement came seemingly out of the blue on Sunday when it was first publicized via the Is- raeli military’s English and Ara- bic-language channels: The military would “pause” its fight- ing during daytime hours along an important humanitarian aid corridor in southern Gaza until further notice. \nAmid some immediate confu- sion over the scope of the pause, a clarification swiftly followed, this time in Hebrew and seem- ingly for domestic consumption. The change did not mean a ces- sation of fighting in the southern Gaza Strip, that statement said, adding that the campaign in the southernmost city of Rafah was continuing. Military officials said the daily pauses were meant only to facilitate the increased distribution of food aid in Gaza, where international organiza- tions have issued dire warnings about hunger. \nThe strange choreography of the messaging became stranger still when the government sug- gested that Prime Minister Ben- jamin Netanyahu only learned of the military’s plan from news reports and signaled his disap- proval. \n# \n# \nBut analysts said it was likely that the prime minister was aware of the plan and that each announcement was tailored to different audiences. The whip- saw statements appeared to reflect the competing pressures facing Mr. Netanyahu, as he juggles demands from the Biden administration and elsewhere around the globe with those of his own hawkish government. His far-right coalition partners oppose any concessions in Gaza, and he relies on their support to stay in power. \nApril 2023, gave birth to a healthy, drug-free boy.

Dressed in camouflage, the newly minted troops had just com- pleted at least 10 days of training in Gudermes, near Grozny, at the Special Forces University, which accepts men from across Russia for general military instruction. Some of the trainees lacked any combat experience. Others were veterans returning to Ukraine for their second or third tour — in- cluding former mercenaries from the Wagner militia, disbanded in 2023 after a short-lived mutiny \nSome Wagner fighters, chafing at the idea of working for the Rus- sian Defense Ministry, instead transferred whole units to the Chechen-trained forces, known as Akhmat battalions, intended in part to absorb fighters from out- side the Russian Army. Wagner veterans were often first recruited from prison, including a lean man with a gold front tooth, identified only by his military call sign, “Jedi,” because of the potential for retribution. \nat the Corewell Health Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Mich., one of the rare programs for a pop- ulation of patients who are among the most reviled in society: preg- nant women and new mothers who are addicted to drugs and al- cohol. \nShe stared at the floor, her black hair curtaining face tattoos of a dagger and stitches, memorials to friends dead from overdose. Inky wings of eyeliner rimmed her eyes. \n“I’m so thankful that you made your way back to us,” she said to Kim. \nThe new policy surrounding the humanitarian corridor — where the military said it would pause fighting from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. daily — went into effect on Saturday, according to military officials. But Mr. Netanyahu insinuated that he did not learn of the plans until Sunday morn- ing. \nDr. Poland, an addiction medi- cine specialist who founded the  Continued on Page A14 \nKim, 32, had first come to the clinic in the fall of 2022 and, in \nThis was Kim’s second preg- nancy with the Great Moms clinic \nKim Short has struggled with drug use since her teens, and relapsed after her first baby’s birth. \nContinued on Page A8 \n“It’s classic Bibi,” said Amos Harel, the military affairs analyst for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname. Like other experts, he said the announcement was unlikely to have been a complete surprise to him, even if the military com- manders did not update him on the exact timing of what they called a tactical change. “He has a mask for every occasion,” Mr. Harel said in an interview. “For the Americans, he needs to show he is doing more to get aid in.

Another was writ- ten by Robert Winnett, whom Mr. Lewis recently announced as The Post’s next executive editor. The use of deception, hacking and fraud is at the heart of a long- running British newspaper scan- dal, one that toppled a major tab- loid in 2010 and led to years of law- suits by celebrities who said that reporters improperly obtained their personal documents and \nPROTESTS  Pro-Palestinian stu- dents in Belgium are adopting a more peaceful approach.
