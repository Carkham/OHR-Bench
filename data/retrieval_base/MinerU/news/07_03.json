But in interviews, peo- ple in the room with him more re- cently said that the lapses seemed to be growing more frequent, more pronounced and more wor- risome. \nOfficials have said President Biden is in excellent shape. \nThe  uncomfortable  occur- rences were not predictable, but seemed more likely when he was in a large crowd or tired after a particularly bruising schedule. In the 23 days leading up to the de- bate against former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Biden jetted across the Atlantic Ocean twice for meetings with foreign leaders and then flew from Italy to Califor- nia for a splashy fund-raiser, maintaining a grueling pace that exhausted even much younger aides. \nDeadly Stampede in India More than 100 were killed by crushing, panicked crowds at a Hindu prayer meeting in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, argued that presidents stand apart from regular people, so protecting them from prosecution if they are accused of abusing their powers to commit official crimes is necessary. \nOn June 10, he appeared to freeze up at an early celebration of the Juneteenth holiday.

On Monday, the court ruled that he is substantially immune from prosecution on charges that he tried to subvert the 2020 elec- tion. On Friday, the court cast doubt on two of the four charges against him in what remains of that prosecution. And in March, the justices allowed him to seek another term despite a constitu- tional provision barring insurrec- \nThe judge in Donald J. Trump’s Manhattan criminal case delayed his sentencing until Sept. 18 to weigh whether a new U.S. Su- preme Court ruling might imperil the former president’s conviction, the judge said Tuesday in a letter to prosecutors and defense law- yers. \nKnown collectively as the Gen- eral Staff Forum, Israel’s military leadership is formed from roughly 30 senior generals, including the military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the commanders of the army, air force and navy, and the head of military intelligence. The military’s attitude to a cease-fire reflects a major shift in its thinking over the past months  \nThe judge, Juan M. Merchan, may ultimately find no basis to overturn the jury’s verdict, but the delay was a surprising turn of events in a case that had led to the first conviction of an American president. With the election on the horizon, the sentencing might be the only moment of criminal ac- countability for the twice-im- peached and four-time-indicted former president whose other cases are mired in delay. \ntionists from holding office. Administrative agencies had a horrible term. In three 6-to-3 rul- ings along ideological lines, the court’s conservative supermajor- ity erased a foundational prece- dent that had required courts to defer to agency expertise, dra- matically lengthened the time available to challenge agencies’ actions and torpedoed the admin- istrative tribunals in which the Se- curities and Exchange Commis- sion brings enforcement actions. The court itself had a volatile term, taking on a stunning array of major disputes and assuming a commanding role in shaping American society and democracy.
