Figure 3.1 shows how over might be condensed in two stages.First,the two terminal posi- tions (which are obviously equal) are fused into a single vertex; then the two positions of value over are fused in a separate step.Fusion can be seen as aloopyanalogueof theReplacementLemma(LemmaII.2.2onpage64). \nTheorem 3.5(Fusion Lemma).Let  $G$  be  $a$  stopper,and assumethatno subpositionof  $G$  hasany dominatedor reversible options.Supposethere are distinct sub positions  $H$  and  $J$  of  $G$  with  $H=J$  .Let  $G^{\\prime}$  beobtainedfrom  $G$  by replacing all moves to  $J$  (throughout all subpositionsof  $G$  )withmoves to  $H$  .Then  $G^{\\prime}$  is also a stopper and  $G^{\\prime}=G$  \nProof.Step 1:We first show that  $G^{\\prime}$  is a stopper. Suppose (for contradic tion) that there is an infinite alternating run \n\n$$\nX_{0}^{\\prime},X_{1}^{\\prime},X_{2}^{\\prime},\\ldots.\n$$\n \nstartingfromsomesubposition  $X_{0}^{\\prime}$  of  $G^{\\prime}$  .Let \n\n$$\nX_{0},X_{1},X_{2},\\dots\n$$\n \nbe the corresponding sequence of subpositions of  $G$  .Toobtain a contradic tion,we'll construct an alternating run \n\n$$\nY_{0},Y_{1},Y_{2},\\ldots\n$$"
