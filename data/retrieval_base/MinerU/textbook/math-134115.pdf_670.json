In this section, we will learn techniques for solving exponential functions. \n# \nThe first technique involves two functions with like bases. Recall that the one-to-one property of exponential functions tells us that, foranyrealnumbers  $b,S,$  and  $T_{i}$  where  $b>0\\,,\\,b\\neq1\\,,\\,b^{S}=b^{T}$  ifandonlyif  $S=T$  \nInotherwords,when an exponential equation has the same base on each side,the exponents must be equal.Thisalsoapplies when the exponents are algebraic expressions.Therefore,wecansolvemany exponential equations by using the rules of exponents torewrite each side asapowerwith thesamebase.Then,weuse thefact thatexponential functionsare one-to-one tosetthe exponents equal to one another,and solve for the unknown \n $3^{4x-7}={\\frac{3^{2x}}{3}}$   $\\boldsymbol{x}$  side so that both sides have the common base,3.Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by setting the exponents equal to one another and solving for  $\\textbf{\\em x}$  \n ${\\begin{array}{r l}&{3^{4x-7}={\\cfrac{3^{2x}}{3}}}\\\\ &{3^{4x-7}={\\cfrac{3^{2x}}{3^{1}}}}\\\\ &{3^{4x-7}=3^{2x-1}}\\\\ &{4x-7=2x-1}\\\\ &{2x=6}\\\\ &{x=3}\\end{array}}$  Rewrite3as  $3^{1}$  Usethe divisionpropertyofexponents Apply the one-to-one propertyof exponents Subtract  $2\\mathbf{x}$  and add 7 to both sides Divideby3"
