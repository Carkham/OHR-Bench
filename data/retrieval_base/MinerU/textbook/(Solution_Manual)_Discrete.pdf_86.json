        "text": "infinite sequence.Now we just need a systematic way toputall theelements  $a_{i j}$  into a sequence.We do this by listing first all the elements  $a_{i j}$  in which  $i+j=2$  (there is only one such pair,  $(1,1)$  ),then all the elementsinwhich  $i+j=3$  (there are only two suchpairs,  $(1,2)$  and  $(2,1)$  ),andsoon;exceptthatwedo not list any element that we have already listed.So,assuming that these elements are distinct,ourliststarts  $a_{11}$  ，  $a_{12}$  ，  $a_{21}$  ，  $a_{13}$  ，  $a_{22}\\,,\\;a_{31}$  ，  $a_{14}$  ,....(If any of these terms duplicates a previous term, then it is simply omitted.)The result of this process will be either an infinite sequence or a finite sequence containing all the elements of the union of the sets  $A_{\\imath}$  .Thus that union is countable\n\n \n29.There are only a finite number of bit strings of each finite length, so we can list all the bit strings by listing first those oflength O,then those of length 1,etc.Thelistingmight be  $\\lambda,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,\\ldots.$  (Recall that  $\\lambda$  denotes the empty string.)Actually this is a special case of Exercise 27: the setof all bit strings is the union of a countable number of countable(actually finite) sets,namely the sets of bit strings of length  $_n$  for  $n=0,1,2,\\ldots\n\n$  \n31.A little experimentation with this function shows thepattern \nf（1,1)=1 f（2,1）=3 f(3,1)=6 f（4,1）=10 f(5,1)=15 f(6,1)=21 f（1,2)=2 f（2,2）=5 f(3,2)=9 f（4,2)=14 f(5,2)=20 f(6,2)=27 f（1,3)=4 f(2,3)=8 f(3,3)=13 f（4,3)=19 f(5,3)=26 f(1,4)=7 f（2,4)=12 f(3,4)=18 f（4,4)=25 f(1,5)=11 f(2,5)=17 f(3,5)=24 f（1,6)=16f(2,6)=23f（1,7)=22\nWe see by looking at the diagonalsof this table that the function takes on successive values as  $m+n$  increases When  $m+n=2$   $f(m,n)=1$  .When  $m+n=3$  ，  $f(m,n)$  takesonthevalues2and3.When  $m+n=4$   $f(m,n)$  takes on the values 4,5,and 6.And so on.It is clearfrom the formula thattherange ofvalues the  $m+n$   $m+n=x$   $\\textstyle{\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+1$   $\\textstyle{\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+(x-1)$  since  $m$  can assume thevalues  $1,2,3,\\ldots,(x-1)$  under these conditions,and thefirst term in the formulais a fixed positive integer when  $m+n$  is fixed.To showthat thisfunction is one-to-one and onto,we merely need to show that the range of values for  $x+1$  picks up precisely where the range of values for  $\\mathbf{x}$  left off, i.e., that  $f(x-1,1)+1=f(1,x)$  .Wecompute:\n\n \n\n$$\nf(x-1,1)+1={\\frac{(x-2)(x-1)}{2}}+(x-1)+1={\\frac{x^{2}-x+2}{2}}={\\frac{(x-1)x}{2}}+1=f(1,x)\n$$\n \n33.It suffices to find one-to-onefunctions  $f:(0,1)\\to[0,1]$  and  $g:[0,1]\\,\\longrightarrow\\,(0,1)$  .We can obviously use the function  $f(x)=x$  in the first case. For the second, we can just compress [O, 1] into, say,  $[\\frac{1}{3},\\,\\frac{2}{3}]$  ; the increasing linear function  $g(x)\\,=\\,(x+1)/3$  will dothat.It thenfollowsfrom theSchroder-Bernstein theorem that  $|(0,1)|=|[0,1]|\n\n$  \n35.We can follow the hint or argue as follows,which really amounts to thesamething.(See the answer key for aproofusingbit strings.)Suppose there were such a one-to-one correspondence  $f$  from  $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  to the power setof  $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  (the set of all subsets of  $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  ).Thus, for each  $x\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  ，  $f(x)$  is  $\\mathbf{a}$  subset of  $\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  .We will derive a contradiction by showing that  $f$  is not onto; we do this by finding an element not in its range. To this end, let  $A\\,=\\,\\{\\,x\\,\\mid\\,x\\,\\not\\in\\,f(x)\\,\\}\\,,$  Weclaim that  $A$  is not in the range of  $f$  .If it were, then  $A\\,=\\,f(x_{0})$  for some  $x_{0}\\in\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$  .Let us look at whether  $x_{0}\\in A$  ornot.On theonehand,if  $x_{0}\\in A$  ,then by the definition of  $A$  it mustbe true that  $x_{0}\\notin f(x_{0})$  ,which means that  $x_{0}\\notin A$  ；that is a contradiction.On the other hand,if if  $x_{0}\\notin A$  ,thenbythedefinitionof  $A$  ,it must be true that  $x_{0}\\in f(x_{0})$  ,which means that  $x_{0}\\in A$  ,again a contradiction.Therefore no such one-to-one correspondence exists."
