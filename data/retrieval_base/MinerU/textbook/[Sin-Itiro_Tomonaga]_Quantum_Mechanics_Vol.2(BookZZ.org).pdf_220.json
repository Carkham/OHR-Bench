(59.12), by the way,is givenby \n\n$$\nP(q)=\\frac{1}{\\bar{\\pi}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\delta}\\exp\\Big\\{-\\frac{1}{\\delta^{2}}\\,(q\\!-\\!q^{0})^{2}\\Big\\}.\n$$\n \n(iv)THE UNCERTAINTYRELATION \nThe two uncertainties  $(\\boldsymbol{\\cal M}\\boldsymbol{q}$  and  $\\varDelta\\phi)$  obtained in the last subsection seem to show a reciprocal relation. Namely, according to Eqs. (59.14) and (59.17),respectively, \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\cal A}q=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\delta}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\cal A}p=\\left(\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\delta\\sqrt{2}}\\,.}}\\end{array}\n$$\n \nThat is,  $\\varDelta q$  is proportional to  $\\pmb{\\delta}$  while  $\\varDelta\\phi$  is to  $1/\\delta$  Therefore, an effort to reduce  $\\varDelta q$  inevitably causes an increase in  $\\varDelta\\phi$  and vice versa \nFrom Eq. (59.20) we find that \n\n$$\n\\varDelta\\phi\\cdot\\varDelta q={\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\frac{h}{2\\pi}}\\,,\n$$\n \nIt says, for instance, that  $\\varDelta\\phi$  approaches infinity if  $\\varDelta q$  tends to O and  $\\varDelta q$  approaches infinity it  $\\varDelta\\phi$  tends to o.In other words, in a state in which the coordinate has a definite value, the value of momentum is completely indefinite and in a state in which themomentum has a definite value, the value of coordinate is completely indefinite. \nThe relation (59.21) has been derived from the consideration of a specific wave packet of the form of Eq. (59.12). The question is then, what happens if we take a state other than that chosen here.We give the answer first. For a general  $\\psi_{i}$  the relation given in Eq. (59.21) does not necessarily hold, but the product  $\\varDelta\\phi\\varDelta q$  never becomes smaller than the value given by Eq. (59.21). We have namely"
