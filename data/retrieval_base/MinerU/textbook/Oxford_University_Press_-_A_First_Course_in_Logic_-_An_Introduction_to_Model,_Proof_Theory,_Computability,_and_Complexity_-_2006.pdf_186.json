        "text": "(ii) Otherwise  $\\varphi_{\\gamma}$   has the form  $\\exists x\\theta(x)$  . In this case let  $T_{\\gamma+1}$  be  $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}\\cup$   $\\{\\theta(c)\\}$  where  $c$  is a constant in  $C$  that does not occur in  $T_{\\gamma}\\cup\\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\}$  .Since  $T_{\\gamma}$  contains fewer than  $\\kappa$  constants of  $C$  ,such a  $c$  exists. \nSo if  $\\beta=\\gamma+1$  ,then  $T_{\\beta}=T_{\\gamma+1}$  is obtained by adding at most a sentence ortwoto  $T_{\\gamma}$  .Since  $T_{\\gamma}$  containsatmost  $|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}$  oftheconstantsin  $C$  ,sodoes  $T_{\\beta}$  Moreover,  $T_{\\beta}$  canbe shown tobe consistentin the samemanner that  $T_{m+1}$  was shown to be consistent in the first claim in the proof of Theorem 4.2. \nNowsupposethat  $\\beta$  is not a successor ordinal.Then it is a limit ordinal. In this case, define  $T_{\\beta}$  as the set of all  $\\nu^{+}$  -sentences that occur in  $T_{\\gamma}$  for some  $\\gamma<\\beta$  .Again,weclaim that  $T_{\\beta}$  is consistentand containsatmost  $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}$  of the constantsin  $C$  \n# \nProofSuppose  $T_{\\beta}$  isnot consistent.Then  $T_{\\beta}\\vdash\\bot$  for some contradiction  $\\perp$  .Since formal proofs are finite,  $\\Delta\\vdash\\bot$  for somefinite subset  $\\Delta$  of  $T_{\\beta}$  .Since it is finite  $\\Delta\\subset T_{\\gamma}$  forsome  $\\gamma<\\beta.\\ \\mathrm{but}$  this contradicts our assumption that any such  $T_{\\gamma}$  is consistent.We conclude that  $T_{\\beta}$  mustbe consistent as was claimed. \nClaim2  $T_{\\beta}$  contains atmost  $|\\beta|$  ofthe constants in  $C$  \nProofFor each  $\\gamma<\\beta$  ,let  $C_{\\gamma}$  be the set of constants in  $C$  that occur in  $T_{\\gamma}$  . Then  $T_{\\beta}$   $U_{\\gamma<\\beta}\\,C_{\\gamma}$   $|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq|\\gamma|+\\aleph_{0}\\leq\n\n$   $|\\beta|+\\aleph_{0}.$  Sinceweare assumingthat  $\\beta$  is a limit ordinal,  $\\beta$  is infinite. In particular\n\n  $\\left|\\beta\\right|+\\aleph_{0}=\\left|\\beta\\right|$  .Soeach  $|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq|\\beta|$  .Itfollows that thenumberof constantsfrom  $C$   occurring in  $T_{\\beta}$  is \n\n$$\n\\left|\\bigcup_{\\gamma<\\beta}C_{\\gamma}\\right|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|C_{\\gamma}|\\leq\\sum_{\\gamma<\\beta}|\\beta|=|\\beta|\\cdot|\\beta|=|\\beta|.\n$$\n \nThis completes the proof of the claim \nSoforeach  $\\beta<\\alpha$  wehave successfully defined a  $\\nu^{+}$  -theory  $T_{\\beta}$  .Thesehave been defined in such a way that  $T_{\\beta_{1}}\\subset T_{\\beta_{2}}$  for  $\\beta_{1}<\\beta_{2}<\\alpha$  \nWenowdefine  $T_{\\alpha}$  astheset of all  $\\nu^{+}$  -sentences thatoccurin  $T_{\\beta}$  forsome  $\\beta<\\alpha$  .Like each  $T_{\\beta}$   $T_{\\alpha}$  isatheory.This can be proved in the samemanner as Claim 1 above.Unlike  $T_{\\beta}$  for  $\\beta<\\alpha$   $T_{\\alpha}$  is a complete theory. This is because each  $\\nu^{+}$  -sentenceis enumerated as  $\\varphi_{\\ell}$  for some  $\\iota<\\alpha$  .Either  $\\varphi_{t}$  or  $\\neg\\varphi_{\\iota}$  is in  $T_{t+1}\\ {\\mathrm{and}}$  ,hence,in  $T_{\\alpha}$  aswell \nSince  $\\Gamma=T_{0}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$  ï¼Œ  $T_{\\alpha}$  has Property 1. Moreover, part (b)ii of the definition of  $T_{\\gamma+1}\\subset T_{\\alpha}$  guarantees that  $T_{\\alpha}$  has Property 2.It was shown in the proof of Theorem 4.2 that any complete theory with Property 2 has a model. Therefore  $T_{\\alpha}$  has a model and  $\\Gamma$  is satisfiable."
