The genomic sequence in each analysis region is partitioned into overlapping 13- mersand the frequency of each 13-mer istabulatedusing Tallymer.

(B)Cumulative dinucleotide repeats analysis shows a higher frequency of dinucleotiderepeatsontheD. mojavensisandD.grimshawiFele- ments (dark blue and purplelines, respectively)thanon the D.mela- \ncandidateis shownin Figure S5.(See File S1 for amore detailed description of this analysis.) \nOverall repeat distribution on the F element:Collectively,therepeat analysisshows the  $\\mathrm{F}$  elements have a higher repeat density than the eu chromatic reference regions in all four Drosophila species.Italso shows that although the  $D$  mojavensis and  $D$  grim shaw iF elements have similar totalrepeat densities,theyhave strikingly differentrepeat compositions.A total of  $75\\%$  of the repeats that overlap with a repeat identified by Window M asker on the  $D_{-}$  mojavensis Felement are transposons(particularly DINE-l elements)compared to only  $27\\%$  onthe  $D_{i}$  grim shaw iF element,whereasthe  $D$  grim shaw iF element shows a greater density of simple and low complexity repeats than the D.mojavensisF element  $39\\%$  Vs.  $20\\%$  .These differences in repeat composition could impact the local chromatin structure and thus the evolution of the resident genes. \n# \nDespiteitshigh repeat density,the distal arm of theD.melanogaster F element contains 79 genes,many of which have important develop mental and housekeeping functions (Riddle et al.20l2).Our manual geneannotations(described previously)showthatthe  $D_{i}$  melanogaster, D.erecta,  $D_{i}$  mojavensis,and  $D_{-}$  grimshawiF elements all have approx- imately80genes.The gene density of the F element is lower than that of the eu chromatic reference regions from the D element  ${\\sim}60$  genes/Mb Vs.  $\\sim\\!\\!80$  genes/Mb)for these four species(TableS6).Amongthefour species,the  $D_{i}$  mojave ns is F element has the lowest gene density(48 genes/Mb compared with 60-66genes/Mb in the other F elements). Thisreflects the increased size of theD.mojave ns is F element dueto the expansion of repetitious elements（1.7Mbvs.1.2-1.3MbintheotherF elements)(TableS 6 and Figure 3). \nAlthough we have produced annotations for all isoforms,our analysis below is based only on the iso form with the largest coding region(i.e.,the most comprehensive iso form)foreachgene.Restrict- ing our analysis to the most comprehensive is of or mallows us to avoid counting the same region multiple times because of alternatives pli c- ing.We initially examined genes at the base,extended,andtelomeric regions(described previously)ofthe  $D$  erectaDelement.Sincethe genes in these three eu chromatic regions exhibit similar character- istics,the primary focus of the following analysis is onthecomparison of genes between the F element and the base of the D element(results for all of the analysisregions are available in FigureS 6).Summary statistics for all of the gene characteristics,and results of multiple comparisontestsaftertheKruskal-Wallis(KW)ranksumtests(Krus- kalandWallis1952),areavailableinFileS6 \n $F$  element genes are larger because they have larger introns and morecoding gexons:Comparisons of the distribution of gene characteristics using violin plots(Hintze andNelson1998)showthat the codingspan(i.e.,theregion that spans from the start codon to the stopcodon,including introns)for F element genesis much larger\n\n (median5156-7569bp)than for genes at the base of the D elements\n\n (median 1028-1736bp)（Figure5,topleft).TheKWtest shows that this difference is statistically significant(p-value:2.12E-48). \nPartofthis difference in the coding span can be attributedtothe significantly higher transposon density（KWtestp-value:2.40E-82) within the introns of F element genes(Figure 5,top center;“repeat sizeisthetotalsizeofthetransposonfragmentswithintheintronsof agene,inbp).Among thefour species analyzed in this study,  $71–83\\%$  of the F element genes contain atleast one transposon fragment in an intron.In contrast, only  $20–46\\%$  of the D element genes contain atleast one transposon fragment.Consistent with the results of the"
