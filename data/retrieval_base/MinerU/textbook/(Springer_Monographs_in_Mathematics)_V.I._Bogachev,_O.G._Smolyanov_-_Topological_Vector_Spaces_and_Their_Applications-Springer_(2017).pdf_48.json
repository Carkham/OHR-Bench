Every precompact subset of  $a$  topological vector spaceis bounded. \nPROOF.Let  $A$  be a pre compact subset of a topological vector space  $E$  and let  $V$  be a neighborhood of zero in  $E$  ；we have to prove that there exists  $\\nu>0$  suchthat  $A\\subset t V$  if  $|t|>\\nu$  .Let  $W$  be a circled neighborhood of zero such that  $W+W\\subset V$  and let  $a_{1},.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}$  beelementsof  $E$  for which  $\\textstyle A\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)$  Let  $\\nu>1$  be such that  $\\{a_{1},\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}\\}\\,\\subset\\,t W$  if  $|t|>\\nu$  .Then for such numbers  $t$  wehave \n\n$$\nA\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+W)\\subset t W+W\\subset t W+t W=t(W+W)\\subset t V,\n$$\n \nwhichshowsthat  $A$  isbounded \n1.5.6.Theorem.A Hausdorff topological vector space  $E$  over the field IR or  $\\mathbb{C}$  isfinite-dimensionalif and only if it possess a compact neighborhood of zero. Moreover,it is sufficient that it possess a pre compact neighborhood of zero. \nPROoF.The necessity is clear from Theorem 1.5.1, since any Hausdorff topo- logical vector space(over an on discrete complete norm ed field  $\\mathbb{K}$  ）offinitedimen- sion  $n$  isisomorphic（as a topological vector space)tothespace  ${\\mathbb K}^{n}$  ,andif  $S$  is a compact neighborhood of zero in  $\\mathbb{K}$  thentheproductof  $n$  copies of  $S$  isa compact neighborhood of zero in  $\\mathbb{K}^{n}$  \nLet us prove the sufficiency (the given proof is due to Gleason).Let  $V$  bea pre compact neighborhood ofzeroin  $E$  andlet  $a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n}\\in E$  beelementssuch that \n\n$$\nV\\subset\\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}{\\Big(}a_{k}+{\\frac{1}{2}}V{\\Big)}.\n$$\n \nWe show that the linear span of the set  $A\\;=\\;\\{a_{1},.\\,.\\,.\\,,a_{n}\\}$  coincides with the wholespace,i.e.,that every element in  $E$  is a linear combination of elements of"
