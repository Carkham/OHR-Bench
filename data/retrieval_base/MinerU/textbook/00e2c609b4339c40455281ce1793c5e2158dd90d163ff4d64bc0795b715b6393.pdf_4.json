Despitea merger between Kluwe r and Reed-Else- vier being called off in the fac c of grow- ing attention from antitrust agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, smaller,qui e ter mergers have proceeded toward the sameend unnoticed.Large commercial publishers are steadily absorbing small- er publishers whose journals canround out their offerings andhelp them achieve brand identity,or critical mass, in specialty areas.In 1998 alone,Kluw- er acquired Waverly/Williams Wilkins,Plenum,and Ovid Technolo- gies;Taylor&Francis acquired Rout- ledge and Carfax;Harcourt/Academic Press acquired Mosby; Bertelsmann,a large entertainment conglomerate,ac- quired Springer Verlag;and Elsevier Science acquired six publishers,includ- ing JAI Press,BioMedNet,and Beil- stein.Smaller publishers undoubtedly see thesemergers as opportunities toget theirtitles intothe electronicmain- stream.For library customers,this trend represents a loss of competition,which docsnotbodewellforpnices. \nwhose e-journals cangohead-to-hcad with verycostly commercial journals but at lower subscription rates.SPARC has successfully launched electronic journals from two well-knownchemical societiesand agroup of distinguished ecologists.Formore onSPARC,see KenFrazier's“Liberating Scholarship, LI10/15/98,p.40-41.—Ed.) \ntheir subscription base in thesc countries by extending credit directly to customers and/or to their agents to keep them from canceling titles. Othcr publishcrs decid- ed to accept the cancellations andreduce theirexposure tolossesfrombadcredit. In the midst of the dilenima are agents, whose profits have alsobeen affectedby libraries that could not pay. \nOn the positive side.the advent of thelong-awaited Euro should have a st a- bilizing effect on periodical pricing, par- ti cula rly for libraries in European coun- tries,in that costs should becomemore transparentwith fewer cross-border cur- rency exchanges.Given the diversity amongnations in theEuropean Union relative tounemployment,inflation,and economic strength,experts split on thc questionof wh c th cr the dollar or the Euro will emerge as the favored curren- cy in 1999.Either way,prices for scri- als sold across the Atlantic will be af- fected, just as they have in the past. \nHighWire Presswas begun by Stanford University Library in 1997 to assist society publishers in getting their journals online.With more than 100 ti- tlesnowamongitsofferingsandwith growing markets in the United States and abroad,HighWire is challenging the assumption that full-featured web jour- nal s have to come from commercial STM publishers.These library-driven strategies,like the ones of the commer- cialpublishers,are fueled byhopes of shaping future markets in theirfavor. \n# \nIn response,libraries,universities, and learned societiesare beginning to experiment with creating criticalmass oftheir own tochallenge commercial publishers and driveprices down.Two such experiments are drawing attenition. SPARC,the Scholarly Publishingand Academic Resources Coalition founded bytheAssociationofResearchLi- braries,uses funds pledged by its mem- be rs to subsidize and support publishers \n# \nPublishers and vendors have taken ahitfrom the economic crises in Asia and in Latin America.Reacting to the threat of significant cancellations in many Asiancountries and in Brazil. some publishers attempted toprotect \n# \nDespitethechaos surrounding electronic jourmals,print subscriptions still command most of the serials dollars in libraries and,therefore,still reguire \nSubscription Services.Table 7 pro- Vi des historical data for about 35 ot i- tles in the index.Price increases for next year are expect cd tobeinthe range of live percent. \n# \nitles in EBSCO Publishing's general index,Magazine Arti- cle Summaries (MAS), are \nthose most often subscribed toby school and public libraries in the Unit- ed States based on data from iE BSC C \n\\begin{table}\n\n\\caption{COST HISTORY FOR TITLES IN MAGAZINE ARTICLE SUMMARIES}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccccccc}\n& Average & Average & Average & Average & Average & Average & Average & Average & Average & Percentage & Percentage & Percentage & Percentage & Percentage\\\\\n& No. of & Cost & Cost & \\% of & Cost & \\% of & Cost & \\% of & Cost & \\% of & Cost & \\%  of & \\% of & \\% of\\\\\nMagazine & Titles & Per Title & Per Title & Change & Per Title & Change & Per Title & Change & Per Title & Change & Per Title &Change & \\% of & \\% of\\\\\nArticle Summaries & '95-'99 & 1995 & 1996 & '95-'96 & 1997 & '96-'97 & 1998 & '97-'98 & 1999 & '99-'99 & 1999 & '99-'99 & Change & Change\\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. & 334 & \\$42.03 & \\$44.07 & 4.9 & \\$46.14 & 4.7 & \\$48.02 & 4.1 & \\$50.32 & 4.8 & \\$50.32 & 4.8 & 19.7 & 19.7\\\\\n\\hline \nNON-U.S. & 10 & 100.02 & 107.94 & 7.9 & 112.41 & 4.1 & 123.15 & 9.6 & 129.48 & 5.1 & 129.48 & 5.1 & 29.5 & 29.5\\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}"
