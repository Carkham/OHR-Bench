At lower temperatures, the bilayer is in a  $L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$  'gel' phase and there is a transition to'fluid' phase,  $L_{\\alpha}$  at higher temperatures due to an increase in mobility of individual lipids in the bilayer.As me c ti cripple phase  $P_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$  isobservedin hydrated lipid bilayer s between the  $L_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$  and  $L_{\\alpha}$  phase.This phase is characterized by corrugations of the membrane surface with well-defined periodicity with an axis parallel to the mean bilayer plane[1].The molecular origin of ripple-phase formation is traditionally been associated with the lipid headgroupregion and hence lipids can be classified intoripple-forming and non-ripple forming lipids based on their headgroups. One of the lipid families belonging toripple-forming classis ph os phat idyl choline s and has been studied in extensive detail[1] \nScheme above shows different physical statesadopted by a lipidbilayerin aqueousmedium[2] \n# \nThe existence of the ripple phase at firstsight isparadoxical on thermodynamic grounds since it involves an apparent lowering of symmetry(from  $L_{\\beta},$  to  $P_{\\beta^{\\prime}}$  )onincreasingthe temperature.Some models suggest that ripples exist because of periodic local spontaneous curvature in the lipid bilayersformed due to electrostatic coupling between water molecules and the polar headgroups or coupling between membrane curvature and molecular tilt. It has also been speculated that ripples form to relieve packing frustrations that arise whenever the relationship between head-group cross sectional area and cross-sectional area of the apolar tails exceeds a certain threshold [1]. However,there is not one conclusive theory to explain ripple phase formation \n# \nConcentrationï¼ˆ%  $\\mathsf{H}_{2}\\mathsf{O})$"
