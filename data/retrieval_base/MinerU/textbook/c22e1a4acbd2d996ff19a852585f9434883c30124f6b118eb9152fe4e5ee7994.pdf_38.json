AH-7614 and EPA maybe stimulating a receptor other thanFFAR4 tomediate these anti- inflammatory effects (although here is no evidence for this in the literature) \nAfter evaluating the data it became apparent that the change in protein expression did not align with our original hypothesis. For the time course experiment, the decrease in IkB after 24 hours of EPA treatment suggests EPA stimulated aninflammatory response and should have increased VCAM-1. However, there was no change in VCAM-1 expression. Previous work in this laboratory evaluated the impact of EPA on Cx43 expression and only observed a decreased in  $\\mathrm{CX43}$  after 48 hours 2. As Cx43 expression is increased by inflammation through the NF-kB pathway  $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}43$  occurred at alater time thanweevaluated(i.e.48hours).However,AH-7614 andEPA decreased VCAM-1 after 24 hours in later experiments (figure 8). The issue with our initial data (figure 5) may be the challenges associated with time course experiments. This likely increased the variability in the data along with the degradation in samples making it difficult to find significance. \nThe majority of this discussion has revolved around the decreased inflammatory response after24hours.However,we also observed an increased inflammatory response after1.5hours (figure 7). This observation is not consistent with the reported anti-inflammatory effects of the FFAR4. However, previous studies evaluating FFAR4 responses used later times (6-48 hours) earliest evaluated pERK, showing a rapid peak after 2.5 minutes 90 that would precede any changes in IrB and/or plKK as phosphorylation of ERK activates the NF-  $\\cdot\\kappa\\mathrm{B}$  pathway(figure3) 9.Responses toFFAR4 (a  $\\mathrm{G}\\mathfrak{o}_{\\mathrm{q}}$  receptor) may initially activate the NF-  $\\cdot\\kappa\\mathrm{B}$  pathwayenoughto"
