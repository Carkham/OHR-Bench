Ponce let was introduced briefly in thelastsection.He gave the main impetus to the revival of projective geometry,having laid the foundations of modern projective geometry while a prisoner of the Russians in the Napoleonic Wars. Brian ch on is most famous for the theorem of projective geometry he proved asastudent.The theorem is known as Brian ch on'sTheorem:Thethree diagonals of a hexagon circumscribed about a conic are concurrent. \nWehavedefinedtheninepointcircleof  $\\triangle A B C$  tobethecircumcircleofthe medialtriangle  $\\triangle A^{\\prime}B^{\\prime}C^{\\prime}$  We first wish to show this circle,whichhascenter  $N$  also passes through the feet of the altitudes.Let  $F_{a}$  bethefootof the altitude through A. So  $F_{a}$  and  $A^{\\prime}$  are both on  $\\overleftrightarrow{B C}$  Wewishtoshow  $N F_{a}=$   $N A^{\\prime}$  Wesuppose  $F_{a}\\neq A^{\\prime}$  .SeeFigure14.17.Now,points  $H$  and  $F_{a}$  areonthe perpendicular to  $\\overleftrightarrow{B C}$  at  $F_{a}$  ,and points  $o$  and  $A^{\\prime}$  are on the perpendicular to  $\\overleftrightarrow{B C}$  at  $A^{\\prime}$  Then,since  $N$  is the midpoint of  $H$  and  $o$  ,point  $N$  must be on the perpendicular bisector of segment  $\\overline{{F_{a}A^{\\prime}}}$  .So  $N F_{a}=N A^{\\prime}$  ,as desired.Likewise,  $N F_{b}=N B^{\\prime}$  and  $N F_{c}=N C^{\\prime}$  ,where  $F_{b}$  and  $F_{c}$  arethefeetofthealtitudesfrom  $B$  and  $C$  respectively.Therefore,thevertices of the or th ic triangle are on the ninepoint circle. \nNowlet  $E_{a},\\,E_{b},$   $E_{c}$  be the midpoints between  $H$  and  $A,B,C,$  ,respectively. SeeFigure14.17.We wish to show these Euler points are also on thenine- point circleof  $\\triangle A B C$  Sincetheproduct  $\\delta_{G,\\mathrm{~-~}1/2}\\,\\delta_{H,\\,2}$  has dilation ratio  $^{-1}$  andfixespoint  $N$  ,then the product is  $\\sigma_{N}$  .So  $\\sigma_{N}(E_{a})=A^{\\prime}$   $\\sigma_{N}(E_{b})=B^{\\prime}$  ,and  $\\sigma_{N}(E_{c})=C^{\\prime}$  .Hence,  $N E_{a}=N A^{\\prime}$   $N E_{b}=N B^{\\prime}$  ,and  $N E_{c}\\,=\\,N C^{\\prime}$  ,asdesired.
