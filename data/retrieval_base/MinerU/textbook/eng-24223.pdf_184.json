The converse is also true. \nFortunately,werarely need to make both of these functions small in the same frequency region \n# \nBefore we discuss these limitations,we quote the following fact from complex analysis \nLet  $H(s)$  be a stable,causal,linear time-invariant continuous-time system.Themaximum modulus principle implies that \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\operatorname*{max}}[H(s)]\\leq\\operatorname*{sup}_{\\omega}\\sigma\\operatorname*{max}[H(j\\omega)]=\\|H\\|_{\\infty}\\quad\\forall s\\in\\mathrm{RHP}\n$$\n \nIn other words, a stable function,which is analytic in the RHP, achieves its maximum value over the RHP when evaluated on the imaginary axis. \nUsing this result, we can arrive at relationships between poles and zeros of the plant  $P$  located in the RHP and limitations on performance(e.g.,disturbance and noise rejection) \n# \nConsider the stable sensitivity function  $S=(1+P K)^{-1}$  for any stabilizing controller,  $K$  ;then, \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{S\\left(z_{i}\\right)=\\left(1+P\\left(z_{i}\\right)K\\left(z_{i}\\right)\\right)^{-1}=1}&{{}{\\mathrm{~for~all~RHP~zeros~}}z_{i}{\\mathrm{~of~}}P}\\\\ {S\\left(p_{i}\\right)=\\left(1+P\\left(p_{i}\\right)K\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\right)^{-1}=0}&{{}{\\mathrm{~for~all~RHP~poles~}}p_{i}{\\mathrm{~of~}}P}\\end{array}\n$$\n \nSincethe  $\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$  norm bounds the gain of a system overall frequencies \n\n$$\n1=|S\\left(z_{i}\\right)|\\leq||S||_{\\infty}\n$$\n \nThismeans thatwe cannot uniformly attenuate disturbances over the entire frequency range if there are zeros in theRHP \n# \nSince the transfer function relating a noise input to the output is  $T=P K(1+P K)^{-1}$  ,an argument for  $T$  similar to  $S$  Canbe made, but with the roles of poles and zeros interchanged.In this case, RHP poles of the plant restrict us from uniformly attenuating noise over the entire frequency range."
