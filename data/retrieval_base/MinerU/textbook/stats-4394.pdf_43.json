The function table( ) provides a quick way to summarize a data vector, to see if anything looks obviously out of place. Executing this function on theclockcolumn, we obtain the following: \n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccccccccccc}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{11}{c}{\\textbf{$\\textgreater$ table(clock)}} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{11}{l}{\\textbf{clock}} \\\\\n\\hline \n48 & 50 & 60 & 64 & 66 & 70 & 75 & 77 & 80 & 85 & 90 & 96 & 99 & 100 & 101 & 110 \\\\\n& 118 & 120 & 125 & 133 & 150 & 166 & 175 & 180 & 190 & 200 & 225 & 231 & 233 & 250 & 266 \\\\\n& 275 & 291 & 300 & 333 & 350 \\\\\n\\hline \n1 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 10 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline  \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\nThe top line shows the unique values that appear in the column.The list of numbers directly below that line is the count of how many times that particular value appeared in thecolumn.Forexample,48appearedonce,while5oappeared threetimes and 60appearedfour times.We see a reasonable range of values with minimum（48）andmaximum（350)values that are not unexpected.Someof thevalues occur onlyonce;the most frequent value occurs ten times,which again does not seem unreasonable.Inshort,we do not see anything obviously amiss with these results.We conclude that the problem likely is with a different data column. \nExecuting thetable(）function on the nextcolumnin the data frame threadsproduces this output: \n\\begin{table}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{$\\geq$ table(\\textit{threads})}} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{threads}} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{1} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{78} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}"
