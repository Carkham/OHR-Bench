Further, his symptoms caused him to experience impairment at home and school. Unlike Michael, Jake probably would be diagnosed with ADHD. \n# \nThe reasons that some children develop ADHD are complex,and it is generally recognized that a single cause is insufficient to explain why an individual child does or does not have the disorder.Researchers have attempted to identify risk factors that predispose a child todevelopADHD.These riskfactors rangein scope from genetic(e.g.,specific gene polymorphisms) tofamilial (e.g., poor parenting) to cultural (e.g., low socioeconomic status). This section will identify some of the risk factors that are thought tocontribute toADHD.Itwill concludeby reviewing some of themore controversial ideas aboutthe causes ofADHD,such as poor parenting and children's diets, and review some of the evidence pertaining to these causes. \nStudies of twins have shown that genetics are primarily responsible for ADHD.
