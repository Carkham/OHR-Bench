        "text": "NOT outline. Think about how you want to organize your essay. Are all issues created equally? What is your plan to address all issules? \nAgoodwayto outlineisto organize your facts aswediscussed above.Forexample,think back to that table \n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Rule Element} & \\textbf{Facts For} & \\textbf{Facts Against} & \\textbf{Resolution} \\\\ \\hline \nSelf-propelled & \\parbox[t]{5cm}{Motor scooters have an engine and \\\\can move without ``manpower''} & \\parbox[t]{5cm}{Can also move with only manpower, \\\\meaning the rider can use their feet \\\\to get it to move} & Which is the predominant use? \\\\ \\hline \nNot running on rails & No rails on a motor scooter & & \\\\ \\hline \nRuns over land & Can't fly & & \\\\ \\hline \n\\end{tabular}\nYou might notice that there isn't much to talk about with“runs over land.\" I mean, a motorized scooter certainly doesn't fly in the air, so this feels obvious. But “self-propelled” seems to have more to discuss! So that means you will likely want to spend more time on the issue of whether a motor scooter is self-propelled than whether it runs overland. \nIf there are multiple issues,you can also use this type of chart to determine which issue requires the most time. \nSpeaking of issues,outlining will help you issue spot.You will heart his as a buzzword all around:thatyouneedto“spotthe issues”or“issuespot.”But what does that mean?Remember that a hypothetical isessentially a story.So your job is to read the story and determine the“issues”or questions to solve.Aprofessor may askyou avery directed question,such as“DidDefendant commitmurder?\",inwhichcase,yourissue-spotting just got much easier!However,it is more than likely that the professor will end thehypothetical storywith“What are the rights of the parties?\"or\"What crimes can Bob be charged with? \nThis means that a large part of earningpoints on your exam is figuring out what issues, or legal problems, to solve.Everyone tackles this in a slightly different way.However,I suggest taking one of the two methods described below and making it your own. \n# \nIn doing the outlining that I mentioned above,you can create a mini-outline or“attack outline,”which is what I just call a checklist. Essentially, it should be a one-page list of the types of law you covered. For example, in a torts class, you are going tocovervarious typesoftorts.Therefore,your checklist might look something like this: \n1.Intentional Torts \na.Assault b.Battery c.False Imprisonment d.Trespass e.Trespass to Chattels f.Conversion Negligence \nNote that this is an incomplete checklist,and the complete version will lookdifferent depending on your professor and class The idea is that if I have this memorized, I can quickly go through the fact pattern to see if any of the torts show up. Part of your checklist might also be to add in “activating facts.\"What I mean by that is, if you are looking for an assault, or a battery, what are you looking for? \nFor example,for battery,I might know that I need a person in thefact pattern to touch anotherperson, soI'm indicating that in my checklist. I can go through the story and think,“Alright,is anyone touching someone else? If so, could that be a battery? Similarly,trespass requires land or entering the land of another.Is that showing up in thefacts?Adding these types of “activatingfacts\"to our checklist might look like this: \n1.Intentional Torts a.Assault"
