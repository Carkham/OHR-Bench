We will frequently write  $\\varepsilon_{w}$  insteadof  $\\varepsilon(w)$  \nThe  $w_{0}$  -induced symmetries have the following effect on Kazhdan-Lusztig representations. \nProposition6.3.5Let  $\\mathcal{C}$  bealeftcell.Then,the following hold \n(i)  $K L_{\\mathcal{C}w_{0}}\\cong\\varepsilon\\,K L_{\\mathcal{C}}$  ii  $K L_{w_{0}c}\\cong\\varepsilon K L_{\\mathcal{C}}$  iii)  $K L_{w_{0}c_{w_{0}}}\\cong K L_{\\mathcal{C}}$  \nProof. We begin with part (i). The key fact is that  $\\widetilde\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{C}w_{0}}$  isobtainedfrom  $\\widetilde\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{C}}$  by reversing the direction of all arrows, keeping their color  $s$  andweight  $\\overline{{\\mu}}$  exceptthatthe  $\\pm1$  weights on loops are switched (cf. Proposition 6.2.9(ii)) This implies on the characterlevel that \n\n$$\nK L_{\\mathcal{C}w_{0}}(x)=\\varepsilon_{x}\\,K L_{\\mathcal{C}}(x^{-1}),\n$$\n \nfor all  $x\\in W$  ï¼›namely the trace of  $A_{\\mathcal{C}w_{0}}(x)$  is the sum of theweightsofall directed circuits in  $\\widetilde\\Gamma_{\\mathcal{C}w_{0}}$  beginning and ending in some  $y\\in\\mathcal{C}w_{0}$  and whose color sequence is  $\\left(s_{1},s_{2},\\ldots,s_{k}\\right)$  for some fixed expression  $x\\,=\\,s_{1}s_{2}\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,s_{k}$  Similarly,  $K L_{\\mathcal{C}}(x^{-1})$  is the sum of the weights of directed circuits in  $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{\\mathcal{C}}$  whose color sequence is  $(s_{k},s_{k-1},.~.~.~,s_{1})$  .By the previous remark, these quantitiesare equal,except possibly for the sign.Whether the sign will change dependson the distribution of thenumber of(+l)-labeledand  $(-1)$  -labeled loops traversed. However, since  $\\widetilde\\Gamma_{(W,S)}$  without its loops is a bipartitegraph(edges connect elements of even length with elements of odd length), and hence every circuit with its loops removed is of even length, a change of sign will take place for each individual path if and only if  $k$  is odd (i.e., if  $\\varepsilon_{x}=-1$  \nNowusethat \n\n$$\nK L_{\\mathcal{C}}(x^{-1})=K L_{\\mathcal{C}}(x)=K L_{\\mathcal{C}}(x),\n$$\n \nwhere the last equality is true because the matrices,and hence character values,arereal.Consequently,the charactersagree,andpart(i)isproved \nFor part (ii), one observes (using Proposition 6.2.9(i)) that  $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{w_{0}c w_{0}}$  isobtained from  $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{\\mathcal{C}}$  by applying the operator  $x\\ \\longmapsto\\ w_{0}x w_{0}$  toallnodes"
