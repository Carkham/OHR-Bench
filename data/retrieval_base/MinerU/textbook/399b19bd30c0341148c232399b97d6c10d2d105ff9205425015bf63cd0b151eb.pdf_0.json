We do not know why Ginkgo keepssuchalargesafety marginfortotalmass.One hypothesis is that because Ginkgo was mostly found in cities,where it does not have nearby trees to compete with reducing pressure to be tall. Lack of neighbors also means Ginkgo are more exposed to thewind. The photographic data we gathered provided usable data thathighlightedevensmall deviations from the models and differences between species. BOTTOMLINE\nTo survive,treesmust complete multiple tasks, which can be optimized for.The closer a tree is to being optimised for a task,the better it does that task,but the more risk it takes on.A species optimization is determined by how well it fits a corresponding model. \nHydraulic efficiency is predicted by Murray's Law,which is based off area being conserved at branching points. Structural support of limbs is predicted by the UniformStressModel (USM).Over optimization(ratio  ${>}1$  )putsbranchesatriskof breaking,so a safety margin must be kept Totalsizeisoptimizedunderthe West-Brown-Enquist(WBE)Model,ifover \nFigure4.ANcOVAforWBEmodel,the slopes of observed and predicted differed statistically significantly.ObservedGinkgc differed from models'predictions most in its optimization for total mass. \nFigure1.Fulltree imageforaGinkgo \nSpecies \n\noptimized trees are more susceptible to wind. These models have previously been used with destructive methods,weaimtodevelopa photographic based methodology,thatcanstill produce precise and accurate enough data to distinguish between models and species. METHODS \nDB Hand scaled photos of the entire tree and first node were taken for 3 o Ginkgo \nFigure5.Comparison of how well Sugar Maple,AmericanBeech,and Gingko fit each model.Ginkgo has a large safety margin to reduce risk of buckling,because of its under optimisation for total mass. \nFigure2.Node1 imagefora Ginkgo \nTreeheight,motherdiameter,daughter diameter,and angle between branches of the basal node were measured using Image J(NiH). For each model a regression compared observeddatafor motherand daughter attributes,and predictedvalues were generated using residuals from the observed dataregression.An AN cov A compared slope andy-intercept of the observed regression andthepredicted. \n\nAs a proof of concept that photographs can yield usable data,our experiments were a success.It is also clear that different species optimize for different tasks,and that for Ginkgo bilo ba minimizing the risk of buckling in the wind is important. \nFigure3. \nNodeimagewithlmageJ measurements labeled."
