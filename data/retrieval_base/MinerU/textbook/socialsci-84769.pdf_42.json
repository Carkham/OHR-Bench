For instance, the construct“attitude toward national health insurance”can be measured using four items shown in Table6.4.As in the Likert scale, the overall scale score may be a summation of individual item scores.Notice that in Like rt scales,the statement changes but the anchors remain thesame across items.However, in semantic differential scales,the statement remains constant,while the anchors(adjective pairs) change across items.Semantic differential is believed to be an excellent technique for measuring people's attitude or feelings toward objects,events,orbehaviors. \nGuttmanscale.Designed by Louis Gut t man,this composite scale uses a series of items arranged in increasing order of intensity of the construct ofinterest,from least intense to most intense.As an example, the construct“attitude toward immigrants”can be measured using five items shown in Table6.5.Each item in the above Gut t man scale has a weight(notindicated above)which varies with the intensity of that item,and the weighted combination of each response is used as aggregate measure of an observation. \nHow willyou rateyour opinions on the following statements about immigrants? \nTable6.5.Afive-item Gut t man scale for measuring attitude toward immigrants \n\\begin{tabular}{|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\hrule height 1pt \\hrule width 1pt  \\tabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\textbf{Do you mind immigrants being citizens of your country} & \\textbf{Yes} & \\textbf{No} & \\tabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\textbf{Do you mind immigrants living in your own neighborhood} & \\textbf{Yes} & \\textbf{No} & \\tabularenet \\tabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\textbf{Would you mind living next door to an immigrant} & \\textbf{Yes} & \\textbf{No} & \\tabulartabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\textbf{Would you mind having an immigrant as your close friend} & \\textbf{Yes} & \\textbf{No} & \\tabulartnarrows \\tabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\textbf{Would you mind if someone in your family married an immigrant} & \\textbf{Yes} & \\textbf{No} & \\Tabularnewline\n\\hline  \n\\end{tabular}\n# \nThe previous section discussed how to measure respondents’responses to predesigned items or indicators belonging to an underlying construct.But how do we create the indicators themselves? The process of creating the indicators is called scaling Moreformally,scalingis a branch of measurement that involves the construction of measures by associating qualitative judgments about unobservable constructs with quantitative,measurable metric units.Stevens (1946) said,“Scaling is the assignment of objects to numbers according to a rule.\" This process of measuring abstract concepts in concrete terms remains one of the most difficult tasks in empirical social science research. \nThe outcome of a scaling process is ascale,which is an empirical structure for measuring items or indicators of a given construct Understand that“scales\",as discussed in this section,are a little different from“rating scales”discussed in the previous section.A ratingscaleis used to capture therespondents’reactions to agivenitem,forinstance,such as anominal scaled item capturesa yes/no reaction and an interval scaled item captures a value between“strongly disagree”to“strongly agree.\"Attaching a rating"
