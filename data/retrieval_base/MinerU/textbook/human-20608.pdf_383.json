        "text": "One very famous example of an on-credible secondary source was a paper,published in a very credible scientific journal,that linked autism tosome of the ingredients in childhood vaccines.Theresult of thisseemingly credible study was that manyparents stopped vaccinating their children out of fear of autism.The result on societywas an increase in childhood diseases, such as measles and whooping cough,that had almost been wiped out in the U.S.andelsewhere.Other scientists tried to replicate the results of the study,but they could not(validating results is also part of academic,especially scientific,inquiry).This failure to replicate the results called into question the validity of the original study.Theoriginal author and the journal recanted the study,so this relationship between vaccines and autism has now been debunked. \n# \nTertiary sources are those sources that have alreadybeen interpreted by two people. These sources are not nearly as reliable as primary and secondary sources because it is nearly impossible for a reader/listener to determineif the interpretation othershave made is logical and accurate/appropriate. Common examples of tertiary sources are magazine articles in which an author uses a number of secondary sources or, lately, newspaper articles that cite other newspaper articles rather than an original source. Blogs are another common tertiary source,and they are rarely credible enough to include as a source for academic writing.(However some academic researchers do have their own blogs,and if their work is generally considered credible, so are their blogs).Tertiary sources are like rumors-you have to take them with“agrainofsalt.”Manytimes,tertiary sources will also be filled with emotive language toget you tofeel a certain way about the topic. This is a clue that your source may not be credible enough \n# \nYour topic and purpose determine whether you must use both primary and secondary sources in your paper.Ask yourself which sources are most likely to provide the information thatwill answer your research questions.If you are writing a research paper about reality television shows, you will need to use some reality shows as a primary source, but secondary sources, such as a reviewer's critique, are also important.If you are writing about the health effects of nicotine,you will probably want to read the published results of scientific studies,but secondary sources,such as magazine articles discussing the outcome of a recent study, may alsobehelpful. \nOnceyou have thought about what kinds of sources are most likely to help you answer your research questions, you may begin your search for print and electronic resources.The challenge here is to conduct your search efficiently.Writers use strategies to helpthemfind the sources that are most relevant and reliable while steering clear of sources that will not be useful. \n# \nThesedays,therereallyisn't much difference in how you find your resources,whether they are print or electronic.Eitherway，you will likelysearchfor them digitally.The only difference is whether you read theread orwatch theresource onlineor hold it and read a print version.Keepinmind,however,that some potentially useful sources maybe available only in print form.Othersmay be only available electronically.The following table lists different types ofresources available atpublic,college,anduniversity libraries. \nTable10.4.1:Library Resources \n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Resource Type} & \\textbf{Description} & \\textbf{Example(s)} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multirow{10}{*}{\\textbf{Reference works}} & \nReference works provide a summary of information about a particular topic. \n& \\\\\n& Almanacs, encyclopedia, atlases, medical reference books, and scientific abstracts are examples of reference works. \n& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& \\textbf{Note that reference works are many steps removed from original primary sources and are often brief, so these should be used only as a starting point when you gather information.} \n& \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multirow{6}{*}{\\textbf{Nonfiction books}} & \nNonfiction books provide in-depth coverage of a topic. \n& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n& ...&  \\\\\n& ...&  \\\\\n& ...&  \\\\\n& ...&  \\\\\n& ...& \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}"
