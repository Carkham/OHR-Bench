In a ventricular escape rhythm, the rate is typically 20-40BPM,thereareno  $\\mathrm{P}$  waves,and the QRS complexes are wide and bizarre: \nFigure1.5.27:Image27,Ventricular Escape Rhythms \nIn an acceleratedventricularrhythm,theirritableventricularsite that hastaken over aspacemakeris contractingat a rate  ${>}40$  ,but isnot a true ventricular tachycardia.Thephysiologyof thisrhythmis similar,but is accelerated due to increased irritability of the pacemakersite: \nFigure1.5.28:Image28,Accelerated Ventricular Rhythms \nVentricular tachycardia is essentially the ventricular version of atrial flutter.With ventricular tachycardia the irritable ventricular site has taken over as pacemaker by depolarizing rapidly..Ventricular tachycardia is not always an indicator that theSA andAV nodeshavefailed,as is usually the case with ventricular escape and accelerated ventricular rhythms;instead the ventricle has taken over as pacemaker by de polarizing at a rate faster than the S Anode. \nFigure1.5.29:Image29,Ventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular tachycardia is sometimes pulseless, but not always. If you see or suspect ventricular tachycardia, it is important to check a pulse before intervening. \nA patient can also have“runs”of ventricular tachycardia.A run of ventricular tachycardia refers to a rhythm that converts from the underlying rhythm to ventricular tachycardia for  ${>}4$  QRS complexes, then reverts to the underlying rhythm.The reversionis important;it isnota“run”of ventricular tachycardia if it never converts back out of ventricular tachycardia"
