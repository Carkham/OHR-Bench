It includes: capabilities,routines, methods, procedures and methodologies embedded in organization.Structural capital is the supportive non-physical infrastructure that enables human capita to function. \nRelational capital,consisting of such elements as customer relationships,supplier relationships,trademarks and trade names (whichhavevalue onlybyvirtue of customer relationships)licenses,andfranchises.Thenotion thatcustomer capitalis separate fromhuman and structural capital indicates its central importance to anorganization'sworth.Thevalueof the relationships a business maintains with its customers andsuppliersis alsoreferred asgoodwill,but often poorly booked incorporate accounts, because of accounting rules \n# \nWoolcock(2oo1) defined social capital as thestocks ofsocial trust,norms and networks thatpeople access to solve joint problems Interrelationships and connectivity between humans arecentral to the formation of social capital,hencewhyit isoften described as the glue that holds society together(Murphy,2o0source4).Inrecentyears,driven by fears over fragmentation of communities and a generalized decline in civic engagement (Foley et al., 2011) social capital has moved up the political agenda in democratic societies.It is,however, a complicated and contested conceptwith differing interpretations of its meaningand usefulness(Quinn 2013). \nColeman (1998) defines social capital by its functions and views it as a resource that can be drawn upon collectively. Its presence encourages certain actions,which facilitate the accomplishment of mutually beneficial ends.Moreover,\"social capitalin thefamily and community play a crucial role in creating human capital (defined as individual skills and abilities in the next generation). Like Coleman,Bourdieu(1985)presents a sociological view of social capital,but he views it primarily as are source for individuals.He defined social capital as'the aggregate of the actual or potential resources,which are linked topossession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition'（Bourdieu,1985p248) \nLike Coleman (1998),Putnam（1995) underlines the collective dimensions of social capital,defining it as features of social organization such as networks,norms and social trust that facilitate co-ordination and cooperation for mutual benefit'.Putnan (1993)argued that the quality of life in societies and their economic sustainability was directly attributable to the features of social organization.He suggested that the hallmarks of a successful society depended upon core attributes of human relationships,the presence or absence of trust,the expectation of reciprocity and the existence of networks.A basic premise underpinning the work of these threetheorists,andindeedsocial capital theoryingeneral,is thatinvestment in social relations is expected toyieldawhole series of returns in the marketplace and beyond. \n# \nA distinction between bonding (exclusive) and bridging (inclusive) forms of social capital is widely made in the literature. Putnam {1993)explains that bonding social capital is inward looking and characterized by strong ties that reinforce exclusive identities, promote homogeneity and create strong in-group loyalty; whereas bridging social capital is outward looking. involves weaker ties andpromotes links between diverse individuals and groups.Putnam suggests that many groups simultaneously bond across some social dimensions and bridge across others.Ingeneral,the dominant sense is that social capital is a forceforgood.However,Leonard(2004)has problem at i zed the fact that policy-makers,seeing how social capital can potentially be converted into other forms of capital, often consider it as a quick-fix solution to complex, long-term structural problems. Indeed, viewing social capital as a'quick-fix'and a panacea for all social ills is a noted criticism levelled at social capital theorists. Putnam's work in particular has been criticized for romanticizing'the world we have lost'and ignoring the downside ofcommunity life. \nOvertime,the growing social capital literature has developed a more critical lens,which acknowledge the inadequacies of the basic framework without abandoning the concept altogether(Muir2osource  $10\\}$  Forexample,intheircritiqueofPutnam'swork,Portes andLandolt(1996)discusshowin,somecases,social capital can constrain individuals'actions and choices.This is because while social capital can promote access to resources,it can equally deny orlimitsuch access."
