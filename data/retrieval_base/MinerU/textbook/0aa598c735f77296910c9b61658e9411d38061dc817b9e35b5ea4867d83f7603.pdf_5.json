School staff issue ODR s to students for serious behavioral violations,including fighting,vandalism,harassment,or noncompliance.ODR s have been shown to possess suf fi- cie nt construct validity as a behavioral measure(Irvin. Tobin,Sprague,Sugai,&Vincent,2004)andadequate concurrent validity with standardized behavior rating scales(McIntosh,Campbell,Carter,&Zumbo,2008；B.Walker,Cheney,Stage,&Blum,2005),andODRshave been moderately correlated with other indirect measures of problembehavior,such as student self-report of delinquent behavior（Gottfredson&Gottfredson,1999).Inaddition, the number and type of ODR s received significantly pre dicta range of future outcomes,including violent events in school and dropout(Tobin&Sugai,1999).Predictive validity from one year to the next for middle and high school students has been documented at.54(Gottfredson &Gottfredson,1999),within thereportedrangeofsome standardized behavior rating scales. \n\nWhen incidents of problem behavior occur in the par- tic ipa ting district,school personnel complete eODR forms,which are entered into the School-WideInformation System(SWIS;Mayetal.,2002),aWeb-based ODRdata system,totallytotal ODRsperyear.To increase there lia bilityofODRdata,the district conducts regular trainings on discriminating between behaviors that do and do not warrant a referral,based on definitions used in the SW IS. \n# \nTheCheck-In/Check-Out intervention was implemented as described in the manual（Croneetal.,2003),withthe school's tier one expectations used as the student behaviors tobe rated（e.g.,Safe,Respectful,Responsible)and no modification or individual iz ation of goals or incentives. Before program implementation,the authors provided two 2-hour training sessions for school personnel andthenpro- vi ded monthly follow-up training sessions that stressed the critical features of the intervention and mechanisms of behavior improvement.The authors advised school admin- is tr at or s to identify school personnel with time at the start and finish of each day to serve as Check-In/Check-Out coordinators and mentors.In four of the schools,theschool counselor served as the program coordinator and mentor for theparticipants.Inoneschool,the special education teacher was the coordinator/mentor,and in the final school, an educational aide was the coordinator/mentor. \nStudents were referred to participate in the Check In/Check-Out intervention by their classroom teachers through their usual school's request for assistance and behavior assistance teamprocess.Prior tobeginning the intervention,each student received a brief training ses- sionconducted by schoolpersonnel that(a)taughtthe daily routines of the Check-In/Check-Out program,(b) provided examples and non examples of appropriate behavior in school, and (c) provided the student opportu- ni ties to practice the daily routinesof theprogram.After training,the student began the program \nMeasurement.Upon referral for behavior support and parent consent,the school notified the researchers and an"
