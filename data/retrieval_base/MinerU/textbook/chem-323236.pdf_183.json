In a large sample of a given molecular compound,all of the individual molecules are identical. \n# \nRecall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains.A molecule of water contains twohydrogenatomsandoneoxygenatom,soitsformulais  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$  A molecule of octane,which is a component of gasoline,  $\\mathrm{C_{8}H_{18}}$  \nFigure 5.8.2:Nitrogen dioxide  $\\mathrm{(NO_{2})}$  is a reddish-brown toxic gas that is a prominent air pollutant produced by internal combustion engines. \nNamingbinary (two-element) molecular compounds is similar to naming simpleionic compounds. The first element in the formula issimply listed using thename of theelement.The second element isnamedby taking the stem of the element name andadding the suffix-ide.A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule.Table 5.8.1 lists these numerical prefixes. \nTable5.8.1:Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds \n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \n\\hline \n\\textbf{Number of Atoms in Compound} & \\textbf{Prefix on the Name of the Element}  \\\\\n\\hline \n1 & mono-* \\\\\n\\hline \n2 & di- \\\\\n\\hline \n3 & tri- \\\\\n\\hline \n4 & tetra- \\\\\n\\hline \n5 & penta- \\\\\n\\hline \n6 & hexa- \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}"
