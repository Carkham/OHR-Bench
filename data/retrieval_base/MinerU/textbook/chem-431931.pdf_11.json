You can do this by adding notes in your lab notebook, such as any issue in thelab,extrasolvent added, a littlebit of spilledpowder,or instrument malfunctions,leading toproblematic datacollected.Ifyouknowyou did something wrong,you candiscard that data as bad data \nThe other method for rejecting a single outlier (you can only perform this procedure once on a dataset) is called the q-test.For  $3\\leq n\\leq10$  ,where  $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{n}}$  is the number of measurements of the same quantity,calculate: \n\n$$\nQ={\\frac{|{\\mathrm{subject~value}}-{\\mathrm{value~closed~to~it}}|}{\\mathrm{highest~value}}}\n$$\n \nCompare thevalue of  $Q$  with  $Q_{c}$  from Table 2. If  $Q>Q_{c}$  ,you can reject the suspect value"
