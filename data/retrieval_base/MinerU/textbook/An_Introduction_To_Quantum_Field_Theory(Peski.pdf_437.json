Formula (12.63), however, is an exact relation. This expression clarifies the relation of  $\\gamma$  to the field strength rescaling.However,it obscures thefactthat  $\\gamma$  is independent of the cutoff A.To understand this aspect of  $\\gamma$  wehaveto  $\\mathrm{go}$  backtothe original definition of this function in terms of renormalized Green's functions,whose cutoff independence foflows from the re normal iz ability of the theory. \nSimilarly.we can find an instructive expression for  $\\beta$  intermsofthe parameters of bare perturbation theory.Our original definition of  $\\beta$  1n Ea.ï¼ˆ12.39)madeuseofaguantity  $\\delta\\lambda$  .definedtobetheshiftoftherenor- malizedcoupling  $\\lambda$  needed to preserve the values ofthebareGreen'sfunc- tionswhen there normalization point is shifted infinitesimal iy.Sincethebare Green's functions depend on thebarecoupling  $\\lambda_{0}$   and the cutoff, this deinl- tioncanberewrittenas \n\n$$\n\\beta(\\lambda)=M\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M}\\lambda\\Big|_{\\lambda_{0},\\Lambda}.\n$$\n \nThus the  $\\beta$  function is the rate of change of there normalized coupling at the scale  $M$  corre s non ding to a fixed bare coupling.Recalling ouran a iy sls in Section 12.1.it is tempting to assoclate  $\\lambda(M)$  withthe coupling constant  $\\lambda^{\\prime}$  obtained by integrating out degrees of freedom down to the scale  $M$  .Witnthis correspondence,the  $\\beta$  function isjusttherate of there normalization group flow of the coupling constant  $\\lambda$  .A positive sign for the  $\\beta$  function indicates a renormalized coupling that increases at large momenta and decreases at small momenta.We can see explicitly that this relation works for  $\\phi^{4}$  theory, to leading order in  $\\lambda$  ,by comparing Eqs.(12.28) and (12.46).We will justify this correspondence further in the following section. \nThe equality of the exact formula(12.64) with the first-order formula (12.53) againfollows from thecounterterm definitions (10.17).As with (12.63), it is no to by io us that this formula for  $\\beta(\\lambda)$  isindependentof  $\\Lambda$  buitthatfact again follows from re normal iz ability.Conversely,it is possible to prove the"
