According to the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) (Center for Sexual Health Promotion,2010),  $74\\%$  ofmalesand  $70\\%$  offemalesaged40-49 engaged in vaginal intercourse during the previous year,while  $58\\%$  Ofmalesand  $51\\%$  offemalesaged50-59didso. \nFigure8.15.Source \nDespite these percentages indicating that middle adults are sexually active,age-related physical changes can affect sexual functioning.Forwomen,decreased sexual desire and pain during vaginal intercourse because of menopausal changes have been identified(Schick et al.,2010).Awoman may also notice less vaginal lubrication during arousalwhich can affect overall pleasure (Carroll,2016).Men may require more direct stimulation for an erection and the erection maybe delayed or less firm(Carroll 2016).Aspreviously discussedmen may experience erectile dysfunction or experience a medical conditions(such as diabetes or heart disease) that impact sexual functioning. Couples can continue to enjoy physical intimacy and may engage in more foreplay, oralsex,andotherformsofsexualexpressionrather thanfocusingasmuchonsexualintercourse. \nRisk of pregnancy continues until a woman has been without menstruation for atleast 12 months,however,and couples should continue touse contraception.People continue to be at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections,suchasgenital herpes, chlamydia, and genital warts. In2014,  $16.7\\%$  of the country's new HIV diagnoses (7,391 of 44,071) were among people 50 and older,accordingto the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention(2014e).Thiswas anincreasefrom  $15.4\\%$  in2005.Practicing safe sex is important at any age,but unfortunately adults over the age of 4 o have the lowest rates of condom use(CenterforSexual HealthPromotion,2o1o).This low rate of condom use suggests the need to enhance education efforts for older individuals regarding STI risks andprevention.Hopefully,when partners understand how aging affects sexual expression,theywill beless likely to misinterpret these changes as a lack of sexual interest or displeasure in the partner andmore able to continue to have satisfying and safe sexual relationships."
