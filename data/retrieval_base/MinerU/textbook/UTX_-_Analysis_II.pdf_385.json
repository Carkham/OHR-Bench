Now, in general, \n\n$$\nN_{0}(F f)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\left|\\int f(x){\\overline{{\\mathbf{e}(x y)}}}d x\\right|\\leq\\int|f(x)|d x=\\|f\\|_{1};\n$$\n \nsince the function  $(x^{2}+1)f(x)$  is bounded by  $N_{2}(f)$  ,by (3),one finds \n\n$$\nN_{0}(F f)\\leq N_{2}(f)\\int\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)^{-1}d x,\n$$\n \nwith a convergent integral whose exact value,  $c=\\pi$  ,is not important.It followsthat \n\n$$\nN_{p,q}({\\hat{f}})=N_{0}\\left(F D^{p}M^{q}f\\right)\\leq c N_{2}\\left(D^{p}M^{q}f\\right);\n$$\n \non applying (5)  $p$  times to thefunction  $M^{q}f$   one finds a result  $\\leq N_{p+2}\\left(M^{q}f\\right)$  uptoaconstantfactor,andbyapplying（6)  $q$  timesto  $f$  one obtains a relation of the form  $N_{p,q}(\\hat{f})\\leq N_{p+q+2}(f)$  up to a constant factor. Remembering the definition(3)of  $N_{r}$  , we finally have \n\n$$\nN_{r}({\\hat{f}})\\leq c_{r}^{\\prime}N_{r+2}(f)\n$$\n \nwhere  $c_{r}^{\\prime}$  is a new constant. This proves the continuity of the Fourier trans- form.Since it isbijectiveand quasi identical to its inverse map by virtue of the relation  $\\widehat{\\widehat{f}}(x)\\,=\\,f(-x)$  ,we conclude that theFourier transform is a bijective and bi continuous map of  $s$  onto  $S$  ,in other words what in topology one calls a home o morphism(lineartoo)of  $s$  onto  $s$  \nWith their systematic recourse to the operators  $D,\\,M$  and  $F$  ,thesecal- culations can appearalittle abstract.Butto write explicitlythe integrals and derivatives which they maskwould be even less enticing \nWe can now return to distribution theory.Following Schwartz,we will call any continuous linear form  $T:S\\to\\mathbb{C}$  a tempered distribution on  $\\mathbb{R}$  .The inequality  $|T(f)|<\\varepsilon$  has to hold for every  $f\\in S$  \\*close enough”to O;this means that there existsan  $r\\in\\mathbb{N}$  anda  $\\delta>0$  suchthat"
