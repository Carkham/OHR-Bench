Obtaining higher education or being an artistic prodigy often corresponds to high status. For example, a college degree awarded from an“Ivy League”university social weighs higher status than a degree from a public statecollege.Just as talented artists,musicians, and athletesreceive honors,privileges,and celebrity status. \nIn addition, the social, political hierarchy of a society or region designates social status. Consider the social labels within class, race, ethnicity,gender,education,profession, age,and family.Labels defining a person's characteristics serve as their position within the larger group.People in a majority or dominant group have higher status（e.g.,rich,White,male,physician,etc.)than those of the minority or subordinate group (e.g., poor, Black, female, housekeeper, etc.). Overall, the location of a person on the social strata influences their social power and participation(Griswold, 2013).Individualswith inferiorpower havelimitations to social and physical resources including lack of authority, influence over others, formidable networks, capital, and money. \nMinority groups are defined as people who receive unequal treatment and discrimination based on social categories such as age, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, religious beliefs, or socio-economic class. Minority groups are not necessarily numerical minorities (Griffith et al., 2015). For example, a large group of people may be a minority group because they lack social power. The physical and cultural traits of minority groups“are held in low esteem by the dominant or majority group which treats them unfairly”(Henslin,2011,p.217).The dominant grouphashigher power and status insociety and receivesgreater privileges.As a result,the dominant group uses its position to discriminate against thosethat are different.The dominantgroupin theUnitedStates is represented by White,middle-class,Protestant people of northern European descent(Doane,2oo5).Minority groups can garner power by expanding political boundaries or through expanded migration though both efforts do not occur with ease and require societal support from both minority and dominant group members. The loss of power among dominant groups threatens not only their authority over other groups but also the privileges and way of life established by this majority \n\nPeople sometimes engage in status shifting togarner acceptanceor avoid attention.DuBois(1903)described the act of people looking through the eyesofothers tomeasure social place orposition as double consciousness.Hisresearch explored thehistory and cultural experiences of the American slavery and theplight of Black folk in translating thinking and behavior between racial contexts.DuBois’research helpedsocial scientists understand how andwhypeople display one identity in certain settings and another in different ones.People must negotiate a social situation to decide how to project their social identity and assign alabel"
