Ifone oftheintegersis zero(remember that both can't bezero),then the greatest common divisor is the absolute value of thenon-zerointeger.Now for the main case,note that the positive divisors of an integer mare the same as the ones of-m.Forthis reason,we may assume that both m and  $n$  arepositive.Afterpossible relabelling of the two numbers,we may further assume that  $\\mathcal{N}>$   $n>0$  \nThe Euclidean algorithm is a repeated application of the division algorithm, Theorem 25.3. Each line is obtained from the previous one by shifting the divisor to the spot previously occupied by the dividend, and the remainder to the spot previously occupied by the divisor.It'seasier tosee than tosay.Hereis theway toseeit: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{m}&{=}&{q_{1}n+r_{1},}\\\\ {n}&{=}&{q_{2}r_{1}+r_{2},}\\\\ {r_{1}}&{=}&{q_{3}r_{2}+r_{3},}\\\\ {.}&{.}&\\\\ {r_{k-3}}&{=}&{q_{k-1}r_{k-2}+r_{k-1},}\\\\ {r_{k-2}}&{=}&{q_{k}r_{k-1}+r_{k},}\\\\ {r_{k-1}}&{=}&{q_{k+1}r_{k}.}\\end{array}\n$$\n \nBy the division algorithm,the remainders satisfy theinequalities  $n~>~r_{1}~>~\\ldots~>~r_{i}~>~r_{i+1}~>~\\ldots~>~0$  This guarantees that the algorithm comes to a halt after finitely many steps.We label the last non-zeroremainder  $r_{k}$  andsolvefor  $r_{k}$  asfollows: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{r_{k}}&{=}&{r_{k-2}-q_{k}r_{k-1}}\\\\ &{=}&{r_{k-2}-q_{k}(r_{k-3}-q_{k-1}r_{k-2})\\,\\,\\,\\,=}&{-q_{k}r_{k-3}+(1+q_{k}q_{k-1})r_{k-2}}\\\\ &&{\\,\\,\\,\\cdot\\,\\cdot}\\\\ &{=}&{x_{0}m+y_{0}n}\\end{array}\n$$"
