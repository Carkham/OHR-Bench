As in the chordal case, we are in fact going to focus on the conform al geometry of the complement  $H_{t}$  of  $K_{t}$  intheunitdiscU.Onefirst has to find a natural time-parametrization.It turns out to be convenient to define the conformal map  $g_{t}$  from  $H_{t}$  onto  $\\mathbb{U}$  that is normalised by \n\n$$\ng_{t}(0)=0\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)>0.\n$$\n \nNote that  $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)\\geq1$  .This can be for instance derived using the fact that  $\\log g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)$  is the limit when  $\\varepsilon\\,\\rightarrow\\,0$  of  $\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$  times the probability that a planar Brownian motion started from  $\\varepsilon$  hitsthe circleof radius  $\\varepsilon^{2}$  before exiting  $H_{t}$  （an analyst would find this justification very strange,for sure). \nThen (and this is simply because with obvious notation,  $({\\widetilde{g}}_{s}\\,\\circ\\,g_{t})(0)\\,=$   $\\tilde{g}_{s}(0)\\circ g_{t}^{\\prime}(0))$  ,one measures the“size”  $a(K_{t})$  of  $K_{t}$  via the derivativeof  $g_{t}$  at theorigin: \n\n$$\ng_{t}^{\\prime}(0)=\\exp(a(t)).\n$$\n \nHence, we will consider growing families of compact sets such that  $a(K_{t})=t$  \nSupposenow that  $(\\zeta_{t},t\\geq0)$  is a continuous function on the unit circle  $\\mathcal{O}\\mathbb{U}$  .Define for all  $z\\in{\\overline{{\\mathbb{U}}}}$  ,thesolution  $g_{t}(z)$  totheODE \n\n$$\n\\partial_{t}g_{t}(z)=-g_{t}(z)\\frac{g_{t}(z)+\\zeta_{t}}{g_{t}(z)-\\zeta_{t}}\n$$\n \nsuchthat  $g_{0}(z)=z$  . This solution is well-defined up to the (possibly infinite time  $T(z)$  definedby \n\n$$\nT(z)=\\operatorname*{sup}\\{t>0~:~\\operatorname*{min}_{s\\in[0,t)}|g_{s}(z)-\\zeta_{s}|>0\\}.\n$$\n \nWethendefine \n\n$$\nK_{t}:=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{U}\\ :\\ T(z)\\leq t\\}\n$$\n \nand \n\n$$\nU_{t}:=\\mathbb{U}\\setminus K_{t}.\n$$\n \nThefamily  $(K_{t},t\\ge0)$  is called the (radial) Loewner chain associated to the drivingfunction  $\\zeta^{-}$  \nThe general statements that we described in the chord al case are also valid in this radial case.One can add one feature that has no analog in the chordalcase:It is possible to estimate the Euclidean distance  $d_{t}$  from0to  $K_{t}$  in terms of  $a(t)\\ =\\ t$  Indeed,since  $U_{t}$  contains the disc  $d_{t}\\times\\mathbb{U}$  ,it is clearthat  $g_{t}^{\\prime}(0)\\leq1/d_{t}$  .On the other hand,a classicalresult of the theoryof"
