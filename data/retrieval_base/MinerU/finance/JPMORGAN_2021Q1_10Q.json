Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of this  Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for additional information. \nComparisons noted in the sections below are for the first  quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, unless  otherwise specified. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase reported net income of   $\\S14.3$   billion for  the first quarter of 2021, or   $\\S4.50$   per share, on net  revenue of   $\\S32.3$   billion. The Firm reported ROE of  $23\\%$    and ROTCE of   $29\\%$  . The Firm's results for the first quarter  of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit  losses of  $\\S5.2$   billion compared to an increase in the  allowance for credit losses of   $\\S6.8$   billion in the prior year,  as well as a  $\\S550$   million contribution to the Firm's  Foundation.  \n\n \n• Net income was  $\\S14.3$   billion, up  $\\S11.4$   billion.\n\n \n• Total net revenue was up   $14\\%$  . Noninterest revenue was   $\\S19.4$   billion, up   $40\\%$  , predominantly driven by higher  CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees,  and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and  Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in  the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in  the prior year. Net interest income was  $\\S12.9$   billion,  down   $11\\%$  , predominantly driven by the impact of lower  rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.     \n• Noninterest expense was  $\\S18.7$   billion, up   $12\\%$  ,  predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue- related expense and continued investments in the  businesses. The increase in expense also included a   $\\S550$    million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.\n\n \n• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of  $\\S4.2$    billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit  losses of  $\\S5.2$   billion, compared to an expense of  $\\S8.3$    billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net  additions to the allowance for credit losses of  $\\S6.8$    billion.   \n\n \n• The total allowance for credit losses was  $\\S25.6$   billion at  March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan  losses to retained loans coverage ratio of   $2.42\\%$  ,  compared with   $2.95\\%$   in the fourth quarter of 2020, and   $2.32\\%$   in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth  quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the  allowance for loan losses.\n\n \n• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled  $\\S10.3$   billion at  March   31, 2021, an increase of  $\\S3.2$   billion from the  prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across  multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the  wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans  placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021,  nonperforming assets decreased  $\\S649$   million from  December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in  the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net  portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas  and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value  in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.  \n\n \n• Firmwide average loans of  $\\S1.0$   trillion were up   $1\\%$  ,  driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly  offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans  also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck  Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.\n\n \n• Firmwide average deposits of  $\\S2.2$   trillion were up   $36\\%$  ,  reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily  driven by the effect of certain government actions in  response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n \n• As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High  Quality Liquid Assets   $\\mathrm{{\\mathrm{\"}H Q L A\")}}$   of approximately  $\\S697$    billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a  fair value of approximately  $\\S841$   billion, resulting in  approximately   $\\S1.5$   trillion of liquidity sources.

The Firm continues to participate  in the Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) PPP and since  inception of the Program has funded approximately   $\\S40$    billion as of April 30, 2021. While the Firm’s temporary  assistance measures for those impacted by the pandemic  have steadily declined since early 2020, the Firm continues  to assist those impacted, primarily in the form of payment  deferrals. \nRefer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for further information  on PPP; Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 48-52 and  Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 for further  information on retained loans under payment deferral.

While the vast majority of its global workforce  continue to work from home, the Firm is actively monitoring  the health and safety situations at local and regional levels,  and will adapt its plans as these situations evolve. \nRegulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19  Pandemic  \nTo address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the U.S. government as well as central banks and banking  authorities around the world have taken and continue to  take actions to help individuals, households and businesses  that have been adversely affected by the economic  disruption caused by the pandemic. In the U.S., several  stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in  March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in  December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in  March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan  facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus  payments to individuals. \n# \nPrior to December 31, 2020 the Firm substantially  completed its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program  which was intended to ensure the continuity of its business  and operations with respect to EU clients. On March 26,  2021, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a Memorandum of  Understanding that sets out a framework for regulatory  cooperation in relation to cross-border financial services.  The Firm will monitor developments and take any necessary  actions to ensure business continuity with respect to the  Firm's EU clients. Refer to Business Developments on page  50 of the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. \n# \nOn March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority  confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of  U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month,  six-month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately  following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The  scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen,  Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two- month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31,  2021, and the Firm is prioritizing those currencies and  tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation in 2021. \nThe Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to  appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR  discontinuation, including contract remediation. The Firm  also continues to monitor the transition relief being  considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the  tax implications of reference rate reform.

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current  presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information. \nInvestment banking fees  increased across products in CIB,  reflecting: \n\n \n• higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO  market due to increased industry-wide fees\n\n • higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of  completed transactions, in part related to transactions  announced in the second half of 2020, and\n\n • higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds  and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees  and wallet share gains. \nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for  additional information. \nPrincipal transactions revenue  increased, in part due to  the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a   $\\S951$   million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other; and  an  $\\S896$   million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the  bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB. \nExcluding these two items, principal transactions revenue  increased in CIB driven by strong performance in:\n\n \n• Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and  prime brokerage, and\n\n • Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products  and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and  Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong  prior year. \nnet gains on certain legacy private equity investments in  Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27   and pages 33-34, and Note 5 for additional information.  Lending- and deposit-related fees  decreased reflecting: • lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher  deposits held in existing and new accounts,  predominantly offset by • higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher  lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees  in CIB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages  23-27 and CB on pages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for  \nAsset management, administration and commissions  revenue  increased driven by higher asset management fees  as a result of:\n\n \n• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity  products and higher average market levels, net of  liquidity fee waivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent, \n\n • higher levels of investment assets on higher average  market levels and net inflows in CCB. \nRefer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22 and  pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information on  asset management, administration and commissions  revenue. \nInvestment securities gains  in both periods reflected the  impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio.  Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and  Note 9 for information on investment securities gains. \nMortgage fees and related income  increased  predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue  reflecting higher production margins and volumes. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, Note 5 and  14 for further information. \nCard income  increased driven by lower acquisition costs,  and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and  credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels.

The decrease in AFS was due to paydowns  and net valuation losses, partially offset by net purchases. \nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34,  Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 65, and  Notes 2 and 9 for additional information on Investment  securities. \n# \n•  the reduction in Card due to the impact of seasonality,   and higher payment rates; lower loans in CB; and net  paydowns in Home Lending \nwere offset by \n•  the origination of PPP loans in CBB and CB; growth in CIB  loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, and in AWM  securities-based and custom lending, as well as  mortgages.  \nThe  allowance for loan losses  decreased consisting of:\n\n \n• a  $\\S4.5$   billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in  the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the  Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential  real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued  improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser  extent portfolio run-off, and \n\n • an  $\\S875$   million net reduction in wholesale, across the  LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's  macroeconomic scenarios. \nThere was a   $\\S107$   million addition to the allowance for  lending-related commitments, which is included in other  liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The total net  reduction to the allowance for credit losses was  $\\S5.2$    billion, as of March 31, 2021."

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major  reportable business segments – Consumer & Community  Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial  Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there  is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the  products and services provided, or the type of customer  served, and they reflect the manner in which financial  information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating  Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed  basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s  use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a  definition of managed basis. \nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present  each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The  management reporting process that derives business  segment results includes the allocation of certain income  and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the  assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications  used for segment reporting, and further refinements may  be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses  the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an  annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business  metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and  analysts in assessing performance.  \nRevenue sharing  \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and  services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business  segments may agree to share revenue from those  transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the  segment responsible for the related product or service, with  allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the  transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue- sharing agreements. \nCapital allocation \nThe amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred  to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and  methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as  a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.  Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional  information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business  segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion  of those methodologies."

Net revenue was   $\\S12.5$   billion, a decrease of  $6\\%$  .  Net interest income was  $\\S7.9$   billion, down  $14\\%$  , driven by: • the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower  loans in Card due to the cumulative impact of lower spend  throughout 2020 and higher payment rates, and lower  loans in Home Lending due to net paydowns, partially offset by • growth in deposits in CBB. Noninterest revenue was   $\\S4.6$   billion, up  $12\\%$  , driven by:\n\n • higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher  production margins and volumes, and \n\n • higher card income due to lower acquisition costs and  higher net interchange income, with debit and credit card  sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by\n\n • lower deposit-related fees given the higher deposits held  in existing and new accounts, and\n\n • lower auto lease volume. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes  in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and  mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest expense was  $\\S7.2$   billion, relatively flat,  reflecting: • higher investments in the business offset by \n\n • lower structural expenses, and\n\n • lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including  lower depreciation on auto lease assets. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of   $\\S3.6$    billion, compared with an expense of  $\\S5.8$   billion in the prior  year, driven by:\n\n • a  $\\S4.6$   billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses,  primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm's  macroeconomic scenarios, consisting of  $\\S3.5$   billion in  Card,  $\\S625$   million in Home Lending, primarily due to the  continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a  lesser extent portfolio run-off,  $\\S350$   million in CBB and   $\\S150$   million in Auto, and\n\n • lower net charge-offs in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs  and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment  assistance and government stimulus. The prior year included a  $\\S4.5$   billion net addition to the  allowance for credit losses. \nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages  47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for  further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance  for credit losses."

Net revenue was a loss of   $\\S473$   million, down  $\\S639$   million.  The decrease was driven by: • lower net interest income on lower rates, as well as  limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to  continued deposit growth, partially offset by  • higher noninterest revenue reflecting net gains on certain  legacy private equity investments compared with net  losses in the prior year, offset by lower investment  securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the  investment securities portfolio, as well as lower gains on  certain Corporate investments. Noninterest expense of   $\\S876$   million was up   $\\S730$   million  primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's  Foundation and higher structural expense.  The current period income tax benefit was driven by the  change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject  to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes as well as the  impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year expected tax rate  relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially  offset by the resolution of certain tax audits."

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale  loan, advises customers and clients on their investment  decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other  products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.  The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and  the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the  interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects  the safety and soundness of the Firm.  \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires,  among other things: \n\n \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and  escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; \n\n • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and  management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \n\n • Firmwide structures for risk governance.  \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation  framework with strong internal governance and  independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the  “Board”).

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or  composition of capital to support the Firm’s business  activities and associated risks during normal economic  environments and under stressed conditions.  \nThe Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of  the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.  \nRefer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3  Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available  on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s  Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and  stress testing. \nBasel III Overview \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital  ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and  internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies  (\"BHCs\") and banks, including the Firm and its insured  depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of  regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is  determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),  which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet  exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive  approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a  standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an  advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the  risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is  evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or  Advanced approaches compared to their respective  minimum capital ratios.  \nThe Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are  currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk- based ratios.  \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced  Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to  calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional  information. \nKey Regulatory Developments \nCECL regulatory capital transition delay.  As part of their  response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided  the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of  CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a  three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022  (“CECL capital transition provisions”).  \nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition  provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31,  2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude  $\\S4.5$   billion,  which is the  $\\S2.7$   billion day 1 impact to retained earnings  and   $25\\%$   of the  $\\S7.0$   billion increase in the allowance for  credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances  on PCD loans).   \nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have  also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average  assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk  Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL  capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting  guidance.   \nSLR temporary revision.  The Federal Reserve issued an  interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the  calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of  calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude  the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities  and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions  became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect  through March 31, 2021.    \nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and FDIC issued an  interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and  remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides  IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary  exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31,  2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this  exclusion. \nPPP.  On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued  an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29,  2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of  participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by  applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated  under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by  the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit  losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had  approximately   $\\S32$   billion of loans under the program.  \nTotal leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR  includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the  Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending  (“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude  them under the final rule.  \nTLAC Holdings rule . On October 20, 2020, the federal  banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the  regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss- Absorbing Capacity (\"TLAC\") debt instruments by certain  large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing  capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital  instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC  debt instruments issued by systemically important banking  organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021  and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s  risk-based capital metrics."

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.  \nThe Firm’s average LCR was  $110\\%$   for the three months  ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. \nThe Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months  ended March 31, 2021, compared with the prior year period  primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from  a significant increase in deposits. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during  the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with both  the three month periods ended December 31, 2020 and  March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits  continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by  the effect of certain government actions in response to the  COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s  reported LCR under the LCR rule. \nThe Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due  to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash  outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.  \n# \nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA  above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities,  such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes  would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities  included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank  affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately   $\\S841$   billion and  $\\S740$   billion as of March   31, 2021 and  December   31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of  liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on  prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased  compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an  increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess  eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was  primarily a result of increased deposits. \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal  Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount window at the  Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the  Firm to such banks of approximately   $\\S301$   billion and  $\\S307$    billion as of March   31, 2021 and December   31, 2020,  respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of  cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or  other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at  the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central  banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this  borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount  window and the other central banks as a primary source of  liquidity. \n# \nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity  requirement for large banking organizations that is intended  to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required”  amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On  October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final  NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as  the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least   $100\\%$   on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become  effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to  publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually  beginning in 2023.  \nThe Firm estimates that it is compliant with the   $100\\%$    minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based  on its current understanding of the final rule."

Deposits are the primary funding source for  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long- term secured borrowings, through the issuance of  \nunsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the  Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company  (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily  funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short- term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or  sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is  invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment  securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term  liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity  risk characteristics.   \nDeposits The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March   31, 2021, and December   31,  2020, and the average deposit balances for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}\n\\hline \n& & & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{Three months ended March 31,} \\\\\n\\cline{4-6}\n\\multirow{-2}{*}{\\textbf{Deposits}} & \\multirow{-2}{*}{\\textbf{March 31,}} & \\multirow{-2}{*}{\\textbf{December 31,}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Average}} \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n(in millions) & \\textbf{2021} & \\textbf{2020} & \\textbf{2021} & \\textbf{2020}\\\\\n\\hline \nConsumer \\& Community Banking & \\$\\textbf{1,037,903} & \\$958,706 & \\$\\textbf{979,686} & \\$739,709\\\\\nCorporate \\& Investment Bank & \\textbf{726,708} & 702,215 & \\textbf{747,087} & 562,226\\\\\nCommercial Banking & \\textbf{295,748} & 284,263 & \\textbf{290,818} & 188,683\\\\\nAsset \\& Wealth Management & \\textbf{217,460} & 198,755 & \\textbf{206,562} & 144,570\\\\\nCorporate & \\textbf{293} & 318 & \\textbf{479} & 998\\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total Firm} & \\textbf{2,278,112} & \\textbf{2,144,257} & \\textbf{2,224,632} & \\textbf{1,636,186}\\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the  Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A  significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer  deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both  considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale  operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of  liquidity because they are generated from customers that  maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

However, during  periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. \nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended  March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended  March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the  LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government  actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "text": "# \n# \nLoan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven  by higher loans in auto and other reflecting PPP loan  originations, partially offset by lower residential real estate  loans. \nResidential real estate:   The residential real estate  portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair  value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and  home equity lines of credit.  \nThe retained loan portfolio declined from December   31,  2020 due to paydowns predominantly in Home Lending  which were largely offset by originations of prime mortgage  loans in Home Lending and AWM. Retained nonaccrual  loans were relatively flat from December   31, 2020. Net  recoveries for the three months ended March   31, 2021  were lower when compared with the same period in the  prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a  loan sale in Home Lending. \nThe loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio  increased from December 31, 2020 largely driven by  warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at fair  value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to  sales in CIB. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit  outstanding was  $\\S22.2$   billion at March   31, 2021. This  amount included  $\\S8.6$   billion of HELOCs that have recast  from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have  been modified and   $\\S7.3$   billion of interest-only balloon  HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm  manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by  closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent  permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material  deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nAt March   31, 2021 and December   31, 2020, the carrying  value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were   $\\S25.9$   billion and  $\\S25.6$   billion, respectively. These loans  have an interest-only payment period generally followed by  an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment  period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly  in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March   31,  2021 were consistent with the broader residential  mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is  generally in line with the performance of the broader  residential mortgage portfolio. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s  residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed  by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale  and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to  certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to  government-insured loans and considers this exposure in  estimating the allowance for loan losses. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n &  & \\textbf{March 31,} & \\textbf{December 31,}  \\\\\n\\textbf{(in millions)} &  & \\textbf{2021} & \\textbf{2020} \\\\\n\\hline \nCurrent & \\$ & 775 & 669  \\\\\n30-89 days past due &  & 146 & 235 \\\\\n90 or more days past due &  & 798 & 874 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total government guaranteed loans} & \\$ & \\textbf{1,719} & \\textbf{1,778} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n# \nRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic  composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s  residential real estate loans. \n# \nThe following table presents information relating to  modified retained residential real estate loans for which  concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing  financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified  PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs.

A  portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s  wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance  sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the  loans that it originates into the market as part of its  syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio  concentrations and credit risk.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as  commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and  guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.  The contractual amounts of these financial instruments  represent the maximum possible credit risk should the  clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm  fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the  clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms  of these contracts. Most of these commitments and  guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,  cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default  occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the  total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related  commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected  future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to  Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment  margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that  are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’  brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily  marketable debt or equity securities).  Because of this  collateral iz ation, no allowance for credit losses is generally   held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the  Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the  required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires  clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to  reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are  reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on  the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage  risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations  in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and  commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in  order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage  certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its  market-making activities, including the counterparty credit  risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses  derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and  other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty  and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the  credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives  the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative  counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),  such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter  (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed  to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the  Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from  derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable  master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.  \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative  transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding  foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically  covered by collateral agreements due to their short  maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily  — was approximately  $88\\%$   at both March   31, 2021, and  December   31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for  additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral  agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of  derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the  Consolidated balance sheets were  $\\S73.1$   billion and   $\\S79.6$    billion at March   31, 2021, and December   31, 2020,  respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market  movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value  of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally  enforceable master netting agreements and the related  cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held  liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm  believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security  when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s  favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets  as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the  appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take  into consideration other collateral, which generally  represents securities that do not qualify as high quality  liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes  is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each  counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables  for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the  net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile  for the periods presented. \nDerivative receivables \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n{} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{March 31, December 31, 2021, 2020}} \\\\\n(in millions) &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total, net of cash collateral} & \\$ & 73,119 & 79,630 \\\\\nLiquid securities and other cash collateral &  &  &  \\\\\nheld against derivative receivables & (13,958) &  & (14,806) \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total, net of liquid securities and other} & \\$ & 59,161 & 64,824 \\\\\nother collateral held against derivative receivables &  &  & (6,022) \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total, net of collateral} & \\$ & 53,445 & 58,802 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}"

The allowance for credit  losses comprises:\n\n \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is  presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n\n • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is  presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts  payable and other liabilities, and\n\n • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,  which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is  recognized within Investment Securities on the  Consolidated balance sheets. \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance  The allowance for credit losses as of March   31, 2021  decreased when compared to December   31, 2020,  consisting of:\n\n \n• a  $\\S4.5$   billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in  the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the  Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential  real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued  improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser  extent portfolio run-off, and\n\n •  a  $\\S716$   million net reduction in wholesale, across the  LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's  macroeconomic scenarios  \nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the  COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the  Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not  experienced in recent history, which has created additional  challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and  increased the reliance on management judgment. These  challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates  remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during  2020.

As a  result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place  significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which  incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the  central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in  weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above  eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six  percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross"

The investment securities  portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in  connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability  management objectives. Principal investments are  predominantly privately-held non-traded financial  instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate.  Investments are typically intended to be held over extended  periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for  short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. \n# \nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated  with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This  risk is mitigated given that the investment securities  portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly  invested in high-quality securities. At March   31, 2021, the  Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of  allowance for credit losses, was   $\\S595.4$   billion, and the  average credit rating of the securities comprising the  portfolio was  $\\mathsf{A A}+$   (based upon external ratings where  available and where not available, based primarily upon  internal risk ratings).

For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this  methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely  aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs  and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,  provides the appropriate information needed to respond to  risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily  aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules  (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s  regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.  \nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling  techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such  changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.  Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page  151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information  regarding model reviews and approvals. \nRefer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for further information regarding VaR, including the  inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk  Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan  Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures  reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,  f or  additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other  components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm  (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and  the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on  pages 140-142 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K  for  further information regarding nonstatistical market risk  measures used by the Firm."

        "text": "# \nnet income is important as interest rate risk represents one  of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk  arises not only from trading activities but also from the  Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include  extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and  issuing debt as well as from the investment securities  portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and  Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk  is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the  Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate  scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which  includes net interest income and certain interest rate  sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and  in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm  conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest  rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.  dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).  These simulations primarily include retained loans,  deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds  transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR  and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page  136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to  a net interest income baseline, over the following 12  months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios  include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term  and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield  curve involving holding short-term rates constant and  increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve  involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term  rates constant. These scenarios consider many different  factors, including:\n\n \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous  changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n\n • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled  prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not  include assumptions about actions that could be taken by  the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any  such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment  assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the  scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,  the time since origination, and other factors which are  updated periodically based on historical experience.\n\n • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit  betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid  could change upon a given change in market interest  rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these  scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due  to repricing lags and other factors. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and  other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s  interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does  not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income  (Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information). \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table  below. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\hline \n{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{March 31,} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{December 31,} \\\\\n(in billions) & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{2021} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{2020} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Parallel shift:} & & & & \\\\\n\\ \\ +100 bps shift in rates & \\$ & 6.0 & \\$ & 6.9 \\\\\n\\textbf{Steeper yield curve:} & & & & \\\\\n\\ \\ +100 bps shift in long-term rates &  & 1.6 &  & 2.4 \\\\\n\\textbf{Flatter yield curve:} & & & & \\\\\n\\ \\ +100 bps shift in short-term rates &  & 4.4 &  & 4.5 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of  March   31, 2021 compared to December   31, 2020 reflected  updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as  well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. \nThe Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets  repricing at a faster pace than deposits. \nBased upon current and implied market rates as of  March   31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could  result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never  experienced an interest rate environment where the  Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While  the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings- at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of  up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income.  In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling  assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require  additional management judgment and therefore, the actual  outcomes may differ from these assumptions. \nThe Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the  table below. \n\\begin{tabular}{llrrr}\n\\hline \n{} &           & March 31, & December 31, & \\\\\n(in billions) &           &           2021 &           2020 & \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\textbf{Parallel shift:}} & & & \\\\\n& +100 bps shift in rates & \\$ & 0.9 & \\$ \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\textbf{Flatter yield curve:}} & & & \\\\\n& +100 bps shift in short-term rates & & 0.9 & 0.8 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario  involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising  by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current  levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at  March   31, 2021 and December   31, 2020."

As a result, the Firm deployed additional  precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks. \nPayment Fraud Risk \nThe risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level  across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19  pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment  authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams  involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of  fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of  these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators  continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for  managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee  and client education and awareness trainings.  \nSubcategories and examples of operational risks Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.  Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk,  Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as  well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are  captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement  processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page  148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk  Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk  Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  10-K for more information.

The safety of the Firm’s employees and  customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency  program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its  critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff,  technology and facilities) in the event of a business  interruption. The program includes governance, awareness  training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as  strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and  manage business interruption and public safety risks. The  strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program  has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s  business operations during and after various events."

        "text": "JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates  are integral to understanding its reported results. The  Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require  management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate  carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has  established policies and control procedures intended to  ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments  made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,  independently reviewed and applied consistently from  period to period. The methods used and judgments made  reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or  liabilities and the related business and risk management  strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are  intended to ensure that the process for changing  methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm  believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of  its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a  brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates  involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents  management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the  remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets  measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet  lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit  losses comprises:\n\n \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n \n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n\n \n• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities,  which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant  judgment on a number of matters including development  and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of  historical loss experience, assessment of risk  characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of  collateral, and the determination of remaining expected  life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's  2020 Form 10-K for further information on these  judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies  used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;  and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64 and  Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in  estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to  the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses  over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s  methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates  hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are  relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit  losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty  variables. The specific variables that have the greatest  effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by  portfolio and geography.\n\n \n\n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.  unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\n\n • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real  GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate  credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices  and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of  economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of  expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet  date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one  reporting period to the next. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market  and weak overall economic conditions that  affected  borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale  lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of  improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of  underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus  strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior  that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors.  Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate  the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery.  \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one  factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit  losses because management considers a wide variety of  factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit  losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may  not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across  all geographies or product types, and changes in factors  and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that  improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration  in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate  macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled  credit losses determined using its central and relative  adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five  scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan  losses and lending-related commitments. The central and  relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of  MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of  those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario  described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative  adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.  unemployment rate through 2021, averaging  $2.4\\%$   higher  over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of  approximately   $4.4\\%$   in the third quarter of 2021; lower  U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining   $2.6\\%$   lower  at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak  difference of nearly  $6.6\\%$   in the third quarter of 2021; and  lower national HPI with a peak difference of  $17.4\\%$   and a  trough in the second quarter of 2022."

        "text": "This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future  changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of  reasons, including:\n\n \n• the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse  scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as  of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing  allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those  estimated under the central scenario\n\n • the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both  interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis  cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes  in macroeconomic variables\n\n • the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in  the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees  not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher  degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss  estimations \n\n • significant changes in the expected severity and duration  of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19  pandemic, effects of government support and customer  assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent  recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of  expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated  sensitivities described below. \nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to  macroeconomic forecasts as of March   31, 2021, the Firm  compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse  scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the  additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse  scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in  other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for  credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison  between these two scenarios reflects the following  differences:\n\n \n• An increase of approximately  $\\S700$   million for residential  real estate loans and lending-related commitments\n\n \n• An increase of approximately  $\\S3.6$   billion for credit card  loans\n\n \n• An increase of approximately  $\\S2.1$   billion for wholesale  loans and lending-related commitments \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss  estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the  overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any  potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative  calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment  management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates  to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled  lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances  and conditions. \nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and  appropriate for the period ended March   31, 2021. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities  at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are  measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including,  derivatives, structured note products and certain securities  financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are  measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including  certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the  carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying  collateral. \nAssets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at  fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified  within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

        "text": "Valuation \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment.  The type and level of judgment required is largely  dependent on the amount of observable market information  available to the Firm. For instruments valued using  internally developed valuation models and other valuation  techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are  therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation  hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more  significant than those required when estimating the fair  value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument  within level 3, management must first determine the  appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to  use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant  inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical  data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,  transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment  speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such  as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of  comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit  curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the  valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable  inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management  judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of  valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,  the Firm’s credit worthiness, market funding rates, liquidity  considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios  that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk  position. The judgments made are typically affected by the  type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the  level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a  whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and  uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider  variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for  positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further  discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing  goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each  business combination is allocated to the related reporting  units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill  impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments  associated with goodwill impairment. \nRefer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,  including the goodwill impairment assessment as of  March   31, 2021. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was  $\\S8.0$   billion and  $\\S7.7$    billion at March   31, 2021 and December   31, 2020,  respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other  liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page  154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description  of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated  with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on page 154-155 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with  the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nRefer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note  30  of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  estimates and judgments associated with establishing  litigation reserves. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or  other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded  for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm  believes its valuation methods are appropriate and  consistent with those of other market participants, the  methods and assumptions used reflect management  judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in  the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or  assumptions different than those used by the Firm could  result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting  date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s  valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of  fair value for individual financial instruments."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a  financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law  in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the  U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in  investment banking, financial services for consumers and  small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction  processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a  further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan  Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the  accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by  regulatory authorities.  \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared  in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual  results could be different from these estimates. In the  opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments  have been included such that this interim financial  information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should  be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated  Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been  reclassified to conform with the current presentation,  including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the  first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred  investment tax credits from accounts payable and other  liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying  value of certain tax-oriented investments. The  reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax  expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with  no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been  revised to conform with the current presentation, including  the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did  not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed  basis. \nConsolidation  \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts  of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has  a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not  included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial  interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is  a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form   10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s  accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables  and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the  related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net  basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally  enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP  also permits securities financing activities to be presented  on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including  the existence of a legally enforceable master netting  agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when  the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information  on offsetting assets and liabilities."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not  applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities  inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities  approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further  discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have  been included in each period presented."

        "text": "(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). \n\n (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be  classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March   31, 2021, and December   31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,  private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were  $\\S678$   million and  $\\S670$   million, respectively. Included in these balances at March   December    $\\S55$   million and   $\\S52$   million, respectively, and other assets of  $\\S623$   million and  $\\S618$   million, respectively.\n\n (e) At March      $\\S20.1$   billion and   $\\S15.1$   billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages,  and  $\\S6.0$   billion and  $\\S6.3$   billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans  originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of  $\\S11.9$   billion and  $\\S8.4$   billion, respectively.\n\n (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid  when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit  associated with cash collateral.\n\n (g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. \n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for  further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a  detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for  individual financial instruments.  \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3  financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to  measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the  significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for  those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of  such inputs. While the determination to classify an  instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the  unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,  level 3 financial instruments typically include observable  components (that is, components that are actively quoted  and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the  unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs  are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages  the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial  instruments using securities and derivative positions that  are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative  of the highest and lowest level input used to value the  significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted  averages of the input values presented in the table are  calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that  the input is being used to value.  \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic  average values do not reflect the degree of input  uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the  characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm  and the relative distribution of instruments within the range  of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may  have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation  uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied  volatility levels because the option contracts have different  underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and  weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the  characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each  balance sheet date."

All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant  both individually and in aggregate.\n\n (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price- based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of  $\\S100$  .\n\n (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used."

When a  determination is made to classify a financial instrument  within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair  \nvalue measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments  typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3  components, observable components (that is, components  that are actively quoted and can be validated to external  sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table  below include changes in fair value due in part to  observable factors that are part of the valuation  methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable  components of level 3 financial instruments using securities  and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or  2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2  risk management instruments are not included below, the  gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the  effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to  such level 3 instruments."

(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected  structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for  structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors  are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual  maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt  securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The  estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency  residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations."

As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not  place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on  nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise  reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected  losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all  COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for  credit losses.  \nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual  status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would  have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status."

There  were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers  whose residential real estate loans have been modified in  TDRs.   \n# \nThe Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as  government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,  generally provide various concessions to financially  troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest  rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays  of principal and/or interest payments that would  otherwise have been required under the terms of the  original agreement.  \nThe following table provides information about how  residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under  the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above  during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter  7 loans where the sole concession granted is the  discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other  insignificant modifications that are not considered  concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to  apply the option to suspend the application of accounting  guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and  extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.  \n\\begin{tabular}{lrlr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{Three months ended}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{March 31,}}\\\\\n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textbf{}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\n\\hline \nNumber of loans approved for a trial & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{2021}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{2020}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nmodification & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{1,401}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{1,996}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nNumber of loans permanently modified & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{1,714}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{1,481}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\n\\textbf{Concession granted:}$^{\\mathrc}$ & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\quad} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nInterest rate reduction & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{72 \\%}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{79 \\%}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nTerm or payment extension & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{40}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{81}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\ \nPrincipal and/or interest defrered & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{31}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{11}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nPrincipal forgiveness & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{4}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{4}} & \\multIColumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\nOther$^{\\mathrc}$ & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{51}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{55}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{}}\\\\\n\\cline{1-4}\n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a  percentage of the number of loans permanently modified.

For  residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is  deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments  past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will  generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type  of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the  last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault  levels. \nAt March   31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated  remaining lives of residential real estate loans  permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The  estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated  prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e.,  foreclosures and other forced liquidations)."

As of March   31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing. (b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically  occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March   31, 2021 and 2020. \n# \nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as  they provide various concessions to borrowers who are  experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or  other insignificant modifications that are not considered  concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm  has elected to apply the option to suspend the application  of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES  Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.  The carrying value of TDRs was   $\\S1.2$   billion and   $\\S954$    million as of March   31, 2021, and December 31,  2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was    $\\S428$    million  and  $\\S76$    million for the three months ended  March   31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The new TDRs for  the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily  from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that  included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets  in partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these  modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the  Firm for the three months ended March   31, 2021 and  2020."

        "text": "Discussion of changes in the allowance \nThe allowance for credit losses as of March   31, 2021  decreased when compared to December   31, 2020,  consisting of:\n\n \n• a  $\\S4.5$   billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in  the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the  Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential  real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued  improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser  extent portfolio run-off, and\n\n •  a   $\\S716$   million net reduction in wholesale, across the  LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's  macroeconomic scenarios  \nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the  COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the  Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not  experienced in recent history, which has created additional  challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and  increased the reliance on management judgment. These  challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates  remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during  2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range  of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have  been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately  address these economic circumstances. \nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy,  uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying  labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains,  and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that  could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a  result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place  significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which  incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the  central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in  weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above  eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six  percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP  returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22. \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.  unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows :  \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Assumptions at March 31, 2021}}\\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\\\\[-1em]\n& 2Q21 & 4Q21 & 2Q22\\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. unemployment rate$^{\\text{(a)}}$ & 5.7 \\% & 4.8 \\% & 4.3 \\% \\\\\nCumulative change in U.S. real & & & \\\\\nGDP from 12/31/2019 & 0.2 \\% & 2.7 \\% & 4.3 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n& & & \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\\\\[-1em]\n&  Assumptions at December 31, 2020 & & \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\\\\[-1em]\n& 2Q21 &  4Q21 & 2Q22\\\\\n\\hline \nU.S unemployment rate$^{\\text{(a)}}$ & 6.8 \\% & 5.7 \\% & 5.1 \\% \\\\\nCumulative change in U.S. real & & & \\\\\nGDP from 11/31/2019 & (1.9)\\% & 0.6 \\% & 2.0 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. \nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates  will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future  periods."

(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include  third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,  “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the  general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of  $\\S4.7$   billion and  $\\S5.2$   billion at  March   31, 2021, and December   31, 2020, respectively.  (f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by  other parties. These include, for example, acting as a  derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,  underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee  or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the  analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the  quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not  have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most  significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a  variable interest that could potentially be significant, the  Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records  and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance  sheets in the same manner it would record and report  positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  \n# \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit  vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities  that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other  projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A  third party is typically the general partner or managing  \nmember and has control over the significant activities of the  tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not  consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in  these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return  primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the  projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by  equity investments and funding commitments, was  $\\S23.1$    billion and  $\\S23.6$   billion, of which  $\\S8.5$   billion and   $\\S8.7$    billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December   31,  2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss  exposure amount has been revised to conform with the  current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to  reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its  capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.  Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for  further information on affordable housing tax credits and  Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments."

In certain customer TOB transactions, the  Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a  reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.  \nIn those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,  the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders  for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to  protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the  underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate  customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the  power to make decisions that significantly impact the  economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.  \nThe Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to  customer TOB trusts at March   31, 2021 and December   31,  2020 was   $\\S6.5$   billion and  $\\S6.7$   billion, respectively. The  fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March   31, 2021  and December   31, 2020, was   $\\S10.2$   billion and   $\\S10.5$    billion, respectively.   \n# \nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,  including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial  mortgage.

These loans and excess MSRs  are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the  U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,  credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans  into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae  guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed  by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not  consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these  transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a  limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share  a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans  with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for  additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and  securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for  additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale  of certain excess MSRs."

The Firm typically  elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan  pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the  foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable  requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or  guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes  exercisable, such loans must be reported on the  Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding  liability.

The Firm  has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting  units was not impaired as of March   31, 2021, or  \nDecember   31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to  impairment during the three months ended March   31,  2021 or 2020."

The fair value  considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally  declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing  and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage  loans if servicing is retained.

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial  instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address  the financing needs of its customers and clients. The  contractual amount of these financial instruments  represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm  should the customer or client draw upon the commitment  or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the  guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently  fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most  of these commitments and guarantees have historically  been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without  being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total  contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the  Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit  exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion  of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  Firm’s related accounting policies.  \nTo provide for expected   credit losses in wholesale and  certain consumer lending-related commitments, an  allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments  is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information  regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related  commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts  and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related  financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  at March   31, 2021, and December   31, 2020. The amounts  in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain  scored business banking lending-related commitments  represent the total available credit for these products. The  Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all  available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at  the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card  and certain scored business banking lines of credit by  providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as  permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm  typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60  days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close  HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of  the underlying property, or when there has been a  demonstrable decline in the credit worthiness of the  borrower."

These legal proceedings are at varying stages of  adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each  of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and  a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and  contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and  consumer protection claims), some of which present novel  legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of  reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves  established, for its legal proceedings is from   $\\S0$   to  approximately   $\\S1.5$   billion at March 31, 2021. This  estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses  was based upon information available as of that date for  those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an  estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For  certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an  estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate  of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses  involves significant judgment, given:\n\n \n• the number, variety and varying stages of the  proceedings, including the fact that many are in  \npreliminary stages, \n\n • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple  defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability  (if any) has yet to be determined, \n\n • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the  proceedings, including issues regarding class  certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \n\n • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential  outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm  has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the  court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or  incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,  and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be  a result which the Firm did not take into account in its  estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of  that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s  estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible  losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may  vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal  proceedings. \nAmrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is  investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection  with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore  funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into  residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali  Group (“Amrapali”).   In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil  claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by  home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to  deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have  been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017  pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In  July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order  making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other  parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and  the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,  violated certain currency control and money laundering  provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry  under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)  and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May  2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional  attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings  freezing approximately  $\\S25$    million held by JPMorgan India  Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred  to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A  separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA  violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and  cooperating with the investigation.        \nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank,  N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the  Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major  international oil companies. The account held  approximately   $\\S1.1$   billion in connection with a dispute  among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the  settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid  out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in  accordance with directions received from its clients. In  November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)  commenced a claim in the English High Court for  approximately   $\\S875$   million in payments made out of the  accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the  FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a  complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but  that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on  notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was  unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been  scheduled to commence in February 2022. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm  previously reported settlements with certain government  authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and  trading activities and controls related to those activities.  Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded  guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In  January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment  entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in  January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with  the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the  probation period. The Department of Labor granted the  Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows  the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the  Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until  January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course  for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten- year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition  Commission matter is the remaining FX-related  governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the  South Africa Competition Tribunal."

        "text": "In August 2018, the United States District Court for the  Southern District of New York granted final approval to the  Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by  U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of  federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to  manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought  damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures  and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement  class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the  class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm  and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A  number of these actions remain pending. Further, a  putative class action has been filed against the Firm and  other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain  consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly  inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought  against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on  behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments.  In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and  11 other defendants of that class action for a total of  $\\S10$    million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative  class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct  have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel  and Australia. \nInterchange Litigation.  Groups of merchants and retail  associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging  that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,  conspired to set the price of credit and debit card  interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of  antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases  for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card  interchange, and modifications to certain credit card  network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that  settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded  to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  New York for further proceedings consistent with the  appellate decision. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate  actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other  seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the  parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized  an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior  settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the  defendants collectively contributed an additional   $\\S900$    million to the approximately  $\\S5.3$   billion previously held in  escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019,  the amended agreement was approved by the District  Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s  approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on  the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended  class settlement,  $\\S700$   million has been returned to the  defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with  the settlement agreement. The class action seeking  primarily injunctive relief continues separately. \n\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions  raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as  well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those  actions remain pending. \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and  Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from  various governmental agencies and entities around the  world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s  (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for  various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s  Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss  Competition Commission’s investigation relating to  EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,  continues. In December 2016, the European Commission  issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding  an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to  EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with  the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along  with other banks in various individual and putative class  actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar  LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the  period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has  obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain  other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of  New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims  related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the  defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative  class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was  administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District  Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm,   to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have  appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual  plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging  that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an  unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired  to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans  and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a  motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin  defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit  defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that  rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Defendants opposed that motion,  which remains pending. The Firm’s settlements of putative  class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore  Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate,  and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain  subject to court approval."

        "text": "Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and  Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions  with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,  collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective  investigations relating to historical trading practices by  former employees in the precious metals and U.S.  treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to  2016. \nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement  (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a  criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with  two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain  terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms  of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after  three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully  comply with all of their obligations.   \nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,  JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.  Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary  amount of approximately  $\\S920$    million. A portion of the  total monetary amount includes victim compensation  payments. \nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in  the United States District Court for the Southern District of  New York against the Firm and certain former employees,  alleging a precious metals futures and options price  manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity  Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust  enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the  General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court  consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019,  and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In  Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class  action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying  conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative  class actions have been filed in the United States District  Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern  District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation  of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims  under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the  complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the  Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the  Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these  putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed  their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021. \n Two putative class action complaints have also been filed  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United  States District Court for the Eastern District of New York  against the Firm and certain individual defendants on  behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the  putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the  Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not  disclose certain information relating to the above- referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these  putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed  their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.  \n\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,  Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are  named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New  York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust  law and New York State common law in connection with an  alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous  exchange trading for securities lending transactions.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.  Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which  defendants are opposing. \nWendel.  Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have  been investigating a series of transactions entered into by  senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”)  during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure  their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,  Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a  number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase  cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges  issued an  ordonnance de renvoi  in November 2016,  referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French  tribunal  correctionnel  for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January  2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling  the  mise en examen  of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court  of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September  2018 that a  mise en examen  is a prerequisite for an  ordonnance de renvoi  and in January 2020 ordered the  annulment of the  ordonnance de renvoi  referring JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. to the French  tribunal correctionnel . The  Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power  to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the  Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the  managers of Wendel in January 2021, the  tribunal  correctionnel  directed the criminal authorities to clarify  whether a further investigation should be opened against  JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In  April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear  JPMorgan Chase’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of  the  tribunal correctionnel  at this stage of the proceedings. In  addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil  proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims  are separate, involve different allegations and are at  various stages of proceedings. \nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed  above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as  defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial  number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has  meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its  currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to  defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may  be initiated from time to time in the future."

        "text": "The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its  currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with  the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm  accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable  that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of  the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its  outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its  litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,  upward or downward, as appropriate, based on  management’s best judgment after consultation with  counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was  $\\S28$   million and   $\\S197$   million for the three months ended March 31, 2021  and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the  Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the  future.  \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome  of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek  very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters  present novel legal theories, involve a large number of  parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot  state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of  the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate  resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or  consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase  believes, based upon its current knowledge and after  consultation with counsel, consideration of the material  legal proceedings described above and after taking into  account its current litigation reserves and its estimated  aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal  proceedings currently pending against it should not have a  material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial  condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the  uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no  assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will  not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently  accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational  consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular  matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating  results for a particular period, depending on, among other  factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level  of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.

Origination  date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual  appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the  origination date. \n# \nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current  estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated  collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home  price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area  (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist  of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data  where actual data is not available. As a result, the  estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do  not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;  as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise  and should therefore be viewed as estimates. \n# \nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well  as unused lines, related to the property.

The minimum payment on an option  ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the  introductory period. This introductory rate is usually  significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed  rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once  the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate  charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and  adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The  minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest  accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is  deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.  Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which  converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan  upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date  triggers."

        "text": "Principal transactions revenue :   Principal transactions  revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer  spread, which is the difference between the price at which  the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and  the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.  It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or  termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and  unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and  losses on financial and other instruments (including those  accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in  client-driven market-making activities and on private equity  investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity  instruments, derivatives and commodities (including  physical commodities inventories and financial instruments  that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue  also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and  losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives  designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships  (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign  exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk  management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and  foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.  \nPSU(s) : Performance share units  \nRegulatory VaR:  Daily aggregated VaR calculated in  accordance with regulatory rules. \nREO:  Real estate owned \nReported basis:  Financial statements prepared under U.S.  GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent  adjustments. \nRetained loans :   Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e.  excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). \nRevenue wallet:  Total fee revenue based on estimates of  investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e.,  the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions  in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan  syndications.

Key  differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between  the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for  Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive  approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit  models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,  credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and  asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally  consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III  Advanced. \n\nScored portfolios:  Consumer loan portfolios that  predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit  card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small  business loans. \nS&P : Standard and Poors \nSAR(s) : Stock appreciation rights \nSCB :   Stress capital buffer \nSEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \nSeed capital:  Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products,  such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the  fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to  clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the  manager to develop a track record.

The notes  typically contain embedded (but not separable or  detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for  principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing  throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional  indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates  or indexes.   \nSuspended foreclosures:  Loans referred to foreclosure  where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are  currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss  mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.  \nTaxable-equivalent basis:  In presenting managed results,  the total net revenue for each of the business segments and  the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.  Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax  credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the  managed results on a basis comparable to taxable  investments and securities; the corresponding income tax  impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within  income tax expense."

Based on that evaluation,  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief  Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls  and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and  31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  respectively. \nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of  internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,  because of its inherent limitations, internal control over  financial reporting may not prevent or detect all  misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls  may occur from time to time, and there can be no  assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in  significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal  control in the future and collateral consequences  therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal  control over financial reporting” on page 158 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was  no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three  months ended March   31, 2021, that has materially  affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the  Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. \n# \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal  proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information  that updates the disclosures set forth under Part   I, Item   3:  Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. \n# \nThe following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form  10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented,  sets forth the material risk factors that could affect  JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations.  Readers should not consider any descriptions of such  factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could  affect the Firm. \n# \nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization  declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus  disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19  pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led  to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place  requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other  countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global  economic conditions, including:\n\n \n• significant disruption and volatility in the financial  markets \n\n • significant disruption of global supply chains, and \n\n • closures of many businesses, leading to loss of  revenues and increased unemployment.    \nA prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the  emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar  effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global  economy.  \nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic  have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s  businesses and results of operations, including: \n• reduction in demand for certain products and services  from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting  in lower revenue, and\n\n • increases in the allowance for credit losses. \nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with  the determination of the allowance for credit losses have  heightened performance risk in the economic environment  precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and  government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even  after adjustments have been made to model outputs,  JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses  arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from  these developments."

Those negative effects, including  the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed  \nbecause of the impact of prior and potential future  government stimulus actions or payment assistance  provided to clients and customers.  \nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or  indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or  by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed  to support individuals, households and businesses impacted  by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19  pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase  to:\n\n \n• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\n\n • negative publicity, and \n\n \n• increased exposure to litigation,  \nany or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s  operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its  reputation.

The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over  financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons  performing the equivalent function): \n(a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and  report financial information; and \n(b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the  registrant's internal control over financial reporting. \nDate: May   4, 2021  \n# \nJennifer Piepszak  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer"
