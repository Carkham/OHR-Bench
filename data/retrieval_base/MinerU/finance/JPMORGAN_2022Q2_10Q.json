The Firm had an allowance for loan losses  to retained loans coverage ratio of   $1.69\\%$  , compared  with   $2.02\\%$   in the prior year.\n\n • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled  $\\S7.8$   billion at  June 30, 2022, a net decrease of  $\\S2.0$   billion from the  prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting  improved credit performance in consumer and net  portfolio activity in wholesale.\n\n • Firmwide average loans of  $\\S1.1$   trillion were up   $7\\%$  ,  driven by higher loans across the LOBs.\n\n • Firmwide average deposits of  $\\S2.5$   trillion were up  $9\\%$  ,  reflecting the residual impact associated with  government actions in the prior year. In CCB, the increase  was also driven by growth from new and existing  accounts across both consumer and small business  customers. However, during the second quarter of 2022,  there was a decline in deposits, including in CB due to  migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding  alternatives, and in CCB as consumer spending continued  to grow. \nSelected capital-related metrics\n\n • The Firm’s CET1 capital was   $\\S207$   billion, and the  Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were   $12.2\\%$   and   $12.9\\%$  , respectively.\n\n • The Firm’s SLR was  $5.3\\%$  .\n\n • The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the second quarter of 2022  at   $\\S69.53$  , up  $1\\%$   versus the prior year. Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR  excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed  basis are non-GAAP financial measures.

Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s  placements of its excess cash with various central banks,  including the Federal Reserve Banks. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale  agreements  increased driven by Markets, reflecting:\n\n • higher collateral requirements, higher demand for  securities to cover short positions, and\n\n • the impact of netting on client-driven market-making  activities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities  purchased under resale agreements. Trading assets  increased driven by: \n\n • higher foreign exchange and commodity derivative  receivables as a result of market movements, as well as  higher levels of debt instruments, partially offset by lower  equity instruments, related to client-driven market- making activities in Markets, and\n\n • higher deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information. Investment securities  included the transfer of  $\\S73.2$   billion  of securities from the available-for-sale (“AFS”) to the held- to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio.\n\n •  The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns,  and unrealized losses, recognized in accumulated other  comprehensive income (“AOCI”), predominantly offset by  net purchases.\n\n • The increase in HTM securities was also due to purchases  predominantly offset by paydowns.  \nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 41-42,  Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 74, and  Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.\n\n \n# \n• higher loans in CB as a result of higher revolver utilization  and originations,\n\n • higher retained residential real estate loans in AWM and  Home Lending as a result of originations, net of  paydowns,\n\n • higher balances in Card on higher consumer spending,  and\n\n • higher wholesale loans in CIB, \npartially offset by\n\n \n• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as  sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates,  and\n\n • a decline in CBB due to the impact of PPP loan  forgiveness. \nThe  allowance for loan losses  increased as a result of a net  addition of  $\\S1.4$   billion to the allowance for loan losses,  consisting of  $\\S1.1$   billion in  wholesale  and   $\\S314$   million in  consumer . The addition reflects the increased weight  placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to  the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation,  changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including  the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's  macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance for  loan losses was also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in  the second quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and  Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first  quarter of 2022."

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-54 and  Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major  reportable business segments – Consumer & Community  Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial  Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there  is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the  products and services provided, or the type of customer  served, and they reflect the manner in which financial  information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating  Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed  basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s  use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a  definition of managed basis. \nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present  each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The  management reporting process that derives business  segment results includes the allocation of certain income  and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the  assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications  used for segment reporting, and further refinements may  be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses  the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an  annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business  metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and  analysts in assessing performance.  \nRevenue sharing  \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and  services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business  segments may agree to share revenue from those  transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the  segment responsible for the related product or service, with  allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the  transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue- sharing agreements. \nFunds transfer pricing  \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the  Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and  Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk  and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.  \nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest  rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and  liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the  methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process  are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other  factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest  income to the segments. \nForeign exchange risk \nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and  Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues  and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks  centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate  movements related to the transferred risk in its results. \nCapital allocation \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is  referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and  methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and  as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.  Refer to Line of business equity on page 47, and page 93 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional  information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business  segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion  of those methodologies."

Markets revenue  consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and  other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm  assesses its Markets business performance on a total  revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line  items. For example, securities that generate net interest  income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are  \nreflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.  Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition  of these income statement line items.

        "text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business  activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale  loan, advises customers and clients on their investment  products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.  The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and  the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the  interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects  the safety and soundness of the Firm.  \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires,  among other things: \n\n \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and  escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; \n\n • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and  management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \n\n • Firmwide structures for risk governance.  \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation  framework with strong internal governance and  independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the  “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully  considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and  incentive compensation processes.  \nRisk governance and oversight functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2021  Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight  business activities. \n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline \n& \\textbf{Form 10-Q} & \\textbf{Form 10-K} \\\\\n\\textbf{Risk governance and oversight functions} & \\textbf{page} & \\textbf{page} \\\\\n& \\textbf{reference} & \\textbf{reference} \\\\\n\\hline \nStrategic risk & & 85 \\\\\nCapital risk & 44-49 & 86-96 \\\\\nLiquidity risk & 50-54 & 97-104 \\\\\nReputation risk & & 105 \\\\\nConsumer credit risk & 57-61 & 110-116 \\\\\nWholesale credit risk & 62-70 & 117-128 \\\\\nInvestment portfolio risk & 74 & 132 \\\\\nMarket risk & 75-79 & 133-140 \\\\\nCountry risk & 80-81 & 141-142 \\\\\nOperational risk & 82 & 143-149 \\\\\nCompliance risk & & 146 \\\\\nConduct risk & & 147 \\\\\nLegal risk & & 148 \\\\\n\\textbf{Estimations and Model risk} & & 149 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n# \nThe Firm’s risk management governance and oversight  framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of  risks, and impacts of risks. \n\\begin{tabular}{|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\serieslength}c}\n  \\hline \n  \\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\\textbf{The Firm's risk governance and oversight functions align to:}} \\\\\n  \\hline \n  \\textbf{Drivers of Risks} & \\textbf{Types of Risks} & \\textbf{Impacts of Risks} \\\\\n  \\hline \n  Factors that cause a risk & Categories by which risks manifest themselves & Consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative \\\\\n  \\hline \n  \\end{tabular}\n\nRefer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management  governance and oversight."

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or  composition of capital to support the Firm’s business  activities and associated risks during normal economic  environments and under stressed conditions.  \nRefer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10- K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3  Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available  on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s  capital risk. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital  ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and  internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies  (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured  depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of  regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is  determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),  which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet  exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive  approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a  standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an  advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the  risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is  evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or  Advanced approaches compared to their respective  regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III  Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding  than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.  \nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk.  On  January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach  for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”),   which replaced  the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives  counterparty exposure under the Standardized and  Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not  used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR  in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the  U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel  III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the  Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the  Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately   $\\S40$   billion  based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December  31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30  bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease  in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of  SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser  extent than Standardized.  \nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements  The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1  capital ratio is   $12.5\\%$   by the end of the fourth quarter of  2022. This target is based on the Basel III capital rules  currently in effect, and taking into account the expected  increase in the Firm's Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)  requirement. \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced  Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to  calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding  than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to  SLR on page 47 for additional information. \nKey Regulatory Developments \nCECL regulatory capital transition.  On December 31, 2021,  the CECL capital transition provisions ,  which delayed the  effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired.  Beginning January 1, 2022, the  $\\S2.9$    billion CECL capital  benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being  phased out at  $25\\%$   per year over a three-year period. As of  June   30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining   $\\S2.2$    billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital  transition provisions. \nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased  out   $25\\%$   of the other relevant CECL capital transition  provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier  2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage  exposure.  \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note  1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further  information on CECL capital transition provisions and the  CECL accounting guidance."

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible  HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of  its stand-alone  $100\\%$   minimum LCR requirement, and that  is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded  from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.

This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank  affiliates. The fair value of these securities was  approximately   $\\S826$   billion and  $\\S914$   billion as of June   30,  2022 and December   31, 2021, respectively, although the  amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular  time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions.  The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021,  primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA at  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above. \nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the  Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount  window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral  pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately   $\\S308$    billion as of June   30, 2022 and December   31, 2021. This  borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and  securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other  unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the  Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central  banks.

In CCB, the increase  was also driven by growth from new and existing accounts  across both consumer and small business customers.  However, during the second quarter of 2022, there was a  decline in deposits, including in CB due to migration of non- operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, and in  CCB as consumer spending continued to grow. \nAverage deposits increased for the six months ended  June   30, 2022 compared to the six months ended June   30,  2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs resulting from the  residual effect of certain government actions in the prior  year. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from  new and existing accounts across both consumer and small  business customers.  \nIncreases in Corporate predominantly relate to the Firm's  international consumer growth initiatives.  \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance  Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages  15-16 and pages 20-42, respectively, for further  information on deposit and liability balance trends."

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased  at June   30, 2022, compared with December   31, 2021, due  to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact  of netting on client-driven market-making activities in  Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS  investment securities in Treasury and CIO.  \nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding  primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial  paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in  commercial paper at June   30, 2022, from December   31,  2021, and for the average three and six months ended  June   30, 2022 compared to the prior year period, was due  to higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity  management. \nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold  under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to  investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s  demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix  of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured  financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors."

        "text": "# \n# \nLoans decreased from December   31, 2021 driven by  residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other  loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real  estate loans. \nResidential real estate:   The residential real estate  portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair  value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and  home equity lines of credit. \nRetained loans increased compared to December   31, 2021,  reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained  nonaccrual loans decreased from December   31, 2021  reflecting improved credit performance. Net recoveries for  the three months ended June   30, 2022 were lower when  compared with the same period in the prior year as the  current year recoveries were impacted by lower  prepayments due to higher interest rates. Net recoveries for  the six months ended June   30, 2022 were relatively flat  compared with the same period in the prior year.  \nLoans at fair value decreased from December   31, 2021, as   Home Lending warehouse loan sales outpaced originations  due to higher interest rates and lower loan purchase  activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased  from December   31, 2021 driven by CIB. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit  outstanding was  $\\S16.9$   billion at June   30, 2022. This  amount included  $\\S5.5$   billion of HELOCs that have recast  from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have  been modified and   $\\S5.5$   billion of interest-only balloon  HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm  manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by  closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent  permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material  deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nAt June   30, 2022 and December   31, 2021, the carrying  value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were   $\\S34.4$   billion and  $\\S30.0$   billion, respectively. These loans  have an interest-only payment period generally followed by  an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment  period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly  in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan  portfolio reflected net charge-offs for the three months  ended June   30, 2022 on a loan sale and net recoveries for  the six months ended June   30, 2022. The credit  performance of this portfolio is comparable with the  performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s  residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed  by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for- sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure  to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related  to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in  estimating the allowance for loan losses. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{r}{June 30, 2022} & December 31, 2021 \\\\\n(in millions) & \\multicolumn{2}{r}{2022} & 2021 \\\\\n\\hline \nCurrent              & \\$ & 584 & 689 \\\\\n30-89 days past due  &    & 121 & 135 \\\\\n90 or more days past due &    & 453 & 623 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total government guaranteed loans}               & \\$ & \\textbf{1,158} & \\textbf{1,447} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n# \nRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic  composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s  residential real estate loans. \n# \nThe following table presents information relating to  modified retained residential real estate loans for which  concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing  financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified  purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans not accounted  for as TDRs.

        "text": "In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit  risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and  counterparties, as well as through various operating  services (such as cash management and clearing activities),  securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A  portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s  wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance  sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the  loans that it originates into the market as part of its  syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio  concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is  actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth  reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure  inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,  product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry  discussion on pages 64-67 for further information. \nThe Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held  in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated  exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto  dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is  applied when determining the allowance for credit losses. \nIn the six months ended June   30, 2022, credit continued to  perform well with charge-offs at historically low levels. As  of June   30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming exposure  was driven by a decline in lending related commitments as  a result of net portfolio activity, predominantly in CIB,  partially offset by an increase in nonperforming derivatives.  Nonperforming loans were relatively flat and included  paydowns on exposures to certain Russia and Russia- associated clients that were downgraded in the first quarter  of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 and  Country Risk on pages 80-81 for additional information. \nAs of June   30, 2022, retained loans increased  $\\S23.9$   billion  driven by CB and CIB, partially offset by decreases in AWM. \nWholesale credit portfolio \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Credit exposure} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Nonperforming} \\\\\n\\cline{2-3} \\cline{4-5}\n& \\textbf{Jun 30,} & Dec 31, & \\textbf{Jun 30,} & Dec 31, \\\\\n(in millions) & \\textbf{2022} & 2021 & \\textbf{2022} & 2021 \\\\\n\\hline \nLoans retained & \\$ 584,265 & \\$ 560,354 & \\$ 2,083 & \\$ 2,054 \\\\\nLoans held-for-sale & \\textbf{3,969} & 7,401 & \\textbf{36} & 48 \\\\\nLoans at fair value & \\textbf{33,215} & 32,357 & \\textbf{371} & 343 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Loans} & \\textbf{621,449} & 600,112 & \\textbf{2,490} & 2,445 \\\\\nDerivative receivables & \\textbf{81,317} & 57,081 & \\textbf{447} & 316 \\\\\nReceivables from & & & & \\\\\ncustomers$^{(a)}$ & \\textbf{58,349} & 59,645 & -- & -- \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total} wholesale & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{credit-related assets} & \\textbf{761,115} & 716,838 & \\textbf{2,937} & 2,761 \\\\\n\\textbf{Assets acquired in} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{loan satisfactions} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{Real estate owned} & \\textbf{NA} & NA & \\textbf{82} & 101 \\\\\nOther & \\textbf{NA} & NA & -- & -- \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total} assets acquired & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{in loan satisfactions} & \\textbf{NA} & NA & \\textbf{82} & \\textbf{101} \\\\\nLending-related & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{commitments} & \\textbf{487,500} & 486,445 & \\textbf{397} & 764 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total} wholesale credit & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{portfolio} & \\textbf{\\$1,248,615} & \\textbf{\\$1,203,283} & \\textbf{\\$3,416} & \\textbf{\\$3,626} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Credit derivatives and} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{credit-related notes} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{used in credit} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{portfolio} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{management} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{activities$^{(b)}$} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{Liquid securities and} & & & & \\\\\n\\textbf{other cash collateral} & & & & \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans  to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM; these are reported within  accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance  sheets.\n\n (b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold  through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage  both performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these  derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair  value, was  $\\S31.3$   billion and  $\\S38.2$   billion at June   30, 2022 and December   31, 2021, representing approximately   $2.7\\%$   and   $3.5\\%$   of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by net portfolio activity  and client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, with the largest decreases in Consumer & Retail and  Technology, Media & Telecommunications. Of the   $\\S31.3$   billion of criticized exposure at June   30, 2022, approximately half was  undrawn and   $\\S28.3$   billion was performing. \nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of June   30, 2022, and December   31, 2021.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as  commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and  guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.  The contractual amounts of these financial instruments  represent the maximum possible credit risk should the  clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm  fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the  clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms  of these contracts. Most of these commitments and  guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,  cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default  occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the  total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related  commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected  future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to  Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment  margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that  are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’  brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and  readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of  this collateral iz ation, no allowance for credit losses is  generally held against these receivables. To manage its  credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and  monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,  and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other  collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These  receivables are reported within accrued interest and  accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance  sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage  risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations  in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and  commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives  in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to  manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions  from its market-making activities, including the  counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.  The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its  own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature  of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the  derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is  exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the  credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange- traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and  cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the  Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant  central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where  possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures  arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally  enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral  agreements.  \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative  transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding  foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically  covered by collateral agreements due to their short  maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily  — was approximately  $87\\%$   and  $88\\%$   at June   30, 2022, and  December   31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for  additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral  agreements and for a further discussion of derivative  contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the  Consolidated balance sheets were  $\\S81.3$   billion and   $\\S57.1$    billion at June   30, 2022, and December   31, 2021,  respectively. The increase was driven by higher foreign  exchange and commodity derivative receivables as a result  of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the  fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to  legally enforceable master netting agreements and the  related cash collateral held by the Firm.  \nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash  collateral that may be used as security when the fair value  of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these  purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent  with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in  the LCR rule.  \nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current  credit risk should also take into consideration other  collateral, which generally represents securities that do not  qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.  \nThe benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each  counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master  netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the  derivative receivables for each counterparty. \nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7  government securities, other liquid government agency and  guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity  securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of  transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that  have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm  has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the  reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the  balances and is not included in the tables below, it is  available as security against potential exposure that could  arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative  contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for  additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral  agreements."

        "text": "The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents  management's estimate of expected credit losses over the  remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets  measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet  \nlending-related commitments. The allowance for credit  losses comprises:\n\n • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is  presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n\n • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is  presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts  payable and other liabilities, and\n\n • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,  which is reflected in investment securities on the  Consolidated balance sheets. \nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June   30, 2022 was   $\\S20.0$   billion, an increase of  $\\S1.3$    billion from   December   31, 2021, consisting of:  $\\S1.0$   billion in wholesale  and  $\\S311$   million in consumer. \nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates  will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future  periods. \nRefer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021  Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies  and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for  credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and  investment securities. \nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 57-61,  Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 62-70 and Note 11 for  additional information on the consumer and wholesale  credit portfolios. \nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on  pages 83-85 for further information on the allowance for  credit losses and related management judgments. \nThe change in allowance reflects the increased weight  placed on the adverse scenarios in the current year, due to  the ongoing effects associated with higher inflation,  changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including  the war in Ukraine, and a modest deterioration in the Firm's  macroeconomic forecast. The increase in the allowance was  also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second  quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia- associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter  of 2022. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a  weighted average of five internally developed  macroeconomic scenarios.

This imprecision may be  heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market  conditions occur. For additional discussion on model  uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk  Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form  10-K. \nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s  existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for  enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate  those measures accordingly over time.  \nValue-at-risk  \nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical  risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse  market moves in the current market environment. The Firm  has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating  Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.   \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a  one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss  methodology which approximates a  $95\\%$   confidence level.  For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this  methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely  aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs  and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,  provides the appropriate information needed to respond to  risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily  aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules  (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s  regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.  The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling  techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such  changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the  Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of  new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain  valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the  backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the  requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. \nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.  Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the  historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times  every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number  of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility  during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. \nFor the 12 months ended June   30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 148 of the 261 days, and observed 22 VaR  backtesting exceptions.

        "text": "# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported  net income is important as interest rate risk represents one  of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises  not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s  traditional banking activities, which include extension of  loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and  the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on  page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a  summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions  included in earnings-at-risk. \nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is  through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the  Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate  scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which  includes net interest income and certain interest rate  sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in  the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts  simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate- sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars  and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These  simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits,  deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt  and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer  pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other  sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a  net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months  utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a  parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long- term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve  involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing  long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving  increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates  constant or holding short-term rates constant and  decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many  different factors, including:\n\n \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous  changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n\n \n• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment  and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions  about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients  and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate  changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on  the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with  underlying contractual rates, the time since origination,  and other factors which are updated periodically based on  historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the  baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions  relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.\n\n \n• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,  represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could  change upon a given change in market interest rates. The  deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual  deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other  factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate  exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a  forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook  on page 8 for additional information). \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table  below. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrlcc}\n\\hline \n& & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{June 30, 2022} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{December 31, 2021}\\\\\n(in billions) &  & 2022 &  & 2021 & \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\textbf{Parallel shift:}}\\\\\n~~~+100 bps shift in rates & & \\$ & (1.4) & \\$ & 5.0\\\\\n~~~-100 bps shift in rates & &  & (1.0) &  & NM \\textsuperscript{(a)}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\textbf{Steeper yield curve:}}\\\\\n~~~+100 bps shift in long-term rates & &  & 0.5 &  & 1.8\\\\\n~~~-100 bps shift in short-term rates & &  & (0.4) &  & NM \\textsuperscript{(a)}\\\\\n\\multicolumn {2}{l}{\\textbf{Flatter yield curve:}}\\\\\n~~~+100 bps shift in short-term rates & &  & (1.8) &  & 3.2\\\\\n~~~-100 bps shift in long-term rates & &  & (0.6) &  & NM \\textsuperscript{(a)}\\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not  considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021. \nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of  June   30, 2022 compared to December   31, 2021 reflected  updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher rates as well as the  impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. \nAs of June 30, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the  $+100$   basis  points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the  result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared  to the impact of assets repricing, while a  $_1+100$   basis points  shift in long-term rates and the -100 basis points shift in  rates are primarily the result of a greater impact from assets  repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates  are integral to understanding its reported results. The  Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require  management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate  carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has  established policies and control procedures intended to  ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments  made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,  independently reviewed and applied consistently from  period to period. The methods used and judgments made  reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or  liabilities and the related business and risk management  strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are  intended to ensure that the process for changing  methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm  believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of  its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a  brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates  involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents  management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the  remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets  measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet  lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit  losses comprises:\n\n \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n\n • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant  judgment on a number of matters including development  and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of  historical loss experience, assessment of risk  characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of  collateral, and the determination of remaining expected  life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's  2021 Form 10-K for further information on these  judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies  used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;  and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 71-73 and  Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in  estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to  the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses  over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s  methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates  hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across  the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily  by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific  variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled  losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. \n• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.  unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\n\n \n• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real  GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate  credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices  and HPI. \nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of  economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of  expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet  date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one  reporting period to the next. \nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one  factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit  losses because management considers a wide variety of  factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit  losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may  not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across  all geographies or product types, and changes in factors  and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that  improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration  in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate  macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled  credit losses determined using its central and relative  adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five  scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan  losses and lending-related commitments. The central and  relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of  MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of  those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario  shown on page 71 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative  adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment  rate, averaging approximately   $2.2\\%$   higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately   $3.7\\%$   in the second quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly  $2.9\\%$   lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately  $5.8\\%$   in the second quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of  $17.6\\%$   in the first quarter of 2024. \nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future  changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of  reasons, including:\n\n \n• The allowance as of June   30, 2022, reflects credit losses  beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to  the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n\n \n• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both  interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis  cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes  in macroeconomic variables."

Without considering  offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative  components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the  comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures  below reflect the following differences:\n\n \n• An increase of approximately  $\\S600$   million for residential  real estate loans and lending-related commitments\n\n • An increase of approximately  $\\S2.0$   billion for credit card  loans\n\n • An increase of approximately  $\\S3.0$   billion for wholesale  loans and lending-related commitments  \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss  estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the  overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any  potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative  calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment  management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates  to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled  lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances  and conditions. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are  inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent  economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to  consider the available information and associated risks and  uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its  estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and  appropriate for the period ended June   30, 2022. \n# \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities  at fair value.

        "text": "Valuation \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment.  The type and level of judgment required is largely  dependent on the amount of observable market information  available to the Firm. For instruments valued using  internally developed valuation models and other valuation  techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are  therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value  hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more  significant than those required when estimating the fair  value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument  within level 3, management must first determine the  appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to  use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant  inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical  data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,  transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment  speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such  as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of  comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit  curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the  valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable  inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management  judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of  valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,  the Firm’s credit worthiness, market funding rates, liquidity  considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios  that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk  position. The judgments made are typically affected by the  type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the  level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a  whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and  uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider  variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for  positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further  discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was  $\\S10.6$   billion and  $\\S9.8$    billion at June   30, 2022 and December   31, 2021,  respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other  liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page  152 of JPMorgan Chase’s  2021  Form 10-K for a description  of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated  with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with  the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing  goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on  page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a  description of the significant valuation judgments  associated with goodwill impairment. \nRefer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,  including the goodwill impairment assessment as of  June   30, 2022. \n# \nRefer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note  30  of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  estimates and judgments associated with establishing  litigation reserves. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or  other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded  for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm  believes its valuation methods are appropriate and  consistent with those of other market participants, the  methods and assumptions used reflect management  judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in  the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or  assumptions different than those used by the Firm could  result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting  date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s  valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of  fair value for individual financial instruments."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a  financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law  in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the  U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in  investment banking, financial services for consumers and  small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction  processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a  further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan  Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the  accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by  regulatory authorities.  \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared  in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual  results could be different from these estimates. In the  opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments  have been included such that this interim financial  information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should  be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated  Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  JPMorgan Chase’s  2021  Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been  reclassified to conform with the current presentation.  \nConsolidation  \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts  of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has  a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not  included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial  interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is  a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s  2021  Form  10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s  accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables  and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the  related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net  basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally  enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP  also permits securities financing activities to be presented  on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including  the existence of a legally enforceable master netting  agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances  where it has determined that the specified conditions are  met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s  2021  Form 10-K  for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not  applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities  inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities  approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further  discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have  been included in each period presented."

        "text": "(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). \n\n (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be  classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June   30, 2022, and December   31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,  private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were  $\\S856$   million and  $\\S801$   million, respectively. Included in these balances at June   December    $\\S45$   million and   $\\S51$   million, respectively, and other assets of  $\\S811$   million and  $\\S750$   million, respectively.\n\n (e) At June      $\\S13.5$   billion and  $\\S26.2$   billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and  $\\S7.7$   billion and   $\\S8.2$   billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to  sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of  $\\S4.4$   billion and  $\\S13.6$   billion, respectively.\n\n (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid  when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit  associated with cash collateral. \n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for  further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a  detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for  individual financial instruments.  \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3  financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to  measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the  significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for  those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of  such inputs. While the determination to classify an  instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the  unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,  level 3 financial instruments typically include observable  components (that is, components that are actively quoted  and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the  unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs  are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages  the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial  instruments using securities and derivative positions that  are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative  of the highest and lowest level input used to value the  significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted  averages of the input values presented in the table are  calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that  the input is being used to value.  \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic  average values do not reflect the degree of input  uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the  characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm  and the relative distribution of instruments within the range  of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may  have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation  uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied  volatility levels because the option contracts have different  underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and  weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the  characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each  balance sheet date."

        "text": "Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a  discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in  unobservable inputs and the relationships between  unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of  the underlying instruments and external market factors that  affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s  positions.  \nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the  Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in  fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm  within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and  six months ended June   30, 2022 and 2021. When a  determination is made to classify a financial instrument  within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair  value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments  typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3  components, observable components (that is, components  that are actively quoted and can be validated to external  sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table  below include changes in fair value due in part to  observable factors that are part of the valuation  methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable  components of level 3 financial instruments using securities  and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or  2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2  risk management instruments are not included below, the  gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the  effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to  such level 3 instruments."

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying  value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected  life.

Unlike principal-protected  structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for  structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors  are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure  of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the  occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges,  each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.  \nTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Maximum payout/Notional amount} \\\\\n\\cline{2-7}\n& & & & & & \\\\\nJune 30, 2022 (in millions) & Protection sold & \\makecell{Protection purchased with\\\\ identical underllyings$^{(c)}$} & \\makecell{Net protection (sold)/\\\\ purchased$^{(d)}$} & \\makecell{Other protection\\\\ purchased$^{(e)}$} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Credit derivatives} \\\\\nCredit default swaps & \\$ (473,223) & \\$ 482,758 & \\$ 9,535 & \\$ 3,290 \\\\\nOther credit derivatives$^{(a)}$ & (52,837) & 68,842 & 16,005 & 16,088 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total credit derivatives} \\\\\nCredit-related notes$^{(b)}$ & (526,060) & 551,600 & 25,540 & 19,378 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total} \\\\\n\\hline \n& & & & & \\\\\n& & & & & \\\\\nDecember 31, 2021 (in millions) & Protection sold & \\makecell{Protection purchased with\\\\ identical underlyings$^{(c)}$} & \\makecell{Net protection (sold)/ \\\\ purchased$^{(d)}$} & \\makecell{Other protection\\\\ purchased$^{(\\text{e})}$} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Credit derivatives} \\\\\nCredit default swaps & \\$ 443,481 & \\$ 458,180 & \\$ 14,699 & \\$ 2,269 \\\\\nOther credit derivatives$^{(a)}$ & (56,130) & 79,586 & 23,456 & 13,435 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total credit derivatives} \\\\\nCredit-related notes$^{(\\text{b})}$ & (499,611) & 537,766 & 38,155 & 15,704 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total} \\\\\n\\hline \n& & &  &  & \\\\\n& & &  &  & \\\\\n& & &  &  & \\\\\n& & & &  & \\\\\n& & &  &  & \\\\\n& & &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.  Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual  maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt  securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The  estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, seven years for  agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations."

The lien  position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to  term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.

In  accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that  are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the  lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral  less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves  subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be  negative.\n\n (c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was  not material for the three and six months ended June   30, 2022 and  2021 .\n\n (d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on  the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June   30, 2022."

The increase in the allowance was  also driven by loan growth in Card and CB in the second  quarter of 2022, and client-specific Russia and Russia- associated downgrades in CIB and AWM in the first quarter  of 2022. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a  weighted average of five internally developed  macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios  incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the  central case assumptions provided in the table below,  resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates  above   $4\\%$   through the fourth quarter of 2023, and a  $1.1\\%$    lower U.S. real GDP level exiting the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Assumptions at June 30, 2022}}\\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 4Q22 & 2Q23 & 4Q23 \\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. unemployment rate$^{(\\text{a})}$& 3.6 \\% & 3.6 \\% & 3.7 \\% \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP$^{(\\text{b})}$& 1.3 \\% & 1.7 \\% & 1.2 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n&  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{AssUMptions at December 31, 2021}}\\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2Q22 & 4Q22 & 2Q23 \\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. unemployment rate$^{(\\text{a)}}$& 4.2 \\% & 4.0 \\% & 3.9 \\% \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP$^{(\\text{b)}}$& 3.1 \\% & 2.8 \\% & 2.1 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

Based on such reviews, the Firm has  concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June   30,  2022, or December   31, 2021, nor was goodwill written off  due to impairment during the six months ended June   30,  2022 or 2021."

        "text": "# \nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value  considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally  declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing  and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage  loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the  MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  \nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June   30, 2022 and 2021. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{As of or for the three months} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{As of or for the six months} \\\\\n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{ended June 30,} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{ended June 30,} \\\\\n\\cline{2-4} \\cline{5-7}\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted) & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{2022}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{2022}} \\\\\n\\hline \nFair value at beginning of period & \\textbf{\\$} & 7,294 & 4,470 & \\textbf{\\$} & 5,494 & 3,276 \\\\\nMSR activity: & & & & & & \\\\\nOriginings of MSRs & & 181 & 419 & & 596 & 823 \\\\\nPurchase of MSRs & & 160 & 395 & & 875 & 574 \\\\\nDisposition of MSRs ($^{\\mathrc}$) & & (614) & (25) & & (671) & (24) \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Net additions/(-positions)} & & (273) & 789 & & \\textbf{800} & 1,373 \\\\\n\\hline \nChanges due to collection/realization of expected cash flows & & (236) & (182) & & \\textbf{(468)} & (369) \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: & & & & & & \\\\\nChanges due to market interest rates and other$^{\\mathrc}$ & & 653 & (500) & 1,547 & 336 \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: & & & & & \\\\\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) & & - & 1 & - & (23) \\\\\nDiscount rates & & - & - & - & - \\\\\nPrepayment model changes and other$^{\\mathrc}$ & & 1 & (29) & \\textbf{66} & (44) \\\\\n\\hline \nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions & 1 & (28) & \\textbf{66} & 66 & (67) \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions} & 654 & (528) & \\textbf{1,613} & 269 &  \\\\\n\\hline \nFair value at June 30 & \\$ & 7,439 & 4,549 & \\textbf{7,439} & 4,549 \\\\\nChanges in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at June 30 & \\$ & \\$ & \\textbf{1,613} & \\$ & 269 \\\\\nContractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income & 395 & (528) & \\$ & \\textbf{1,613} &  \\\\\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at June 30, (in billions) & 576 & 465 & 365 & 576 & 598 \\\\\n\\hline \nService advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at June 30, (in billions)$^{\\mathrc}$ & 1.2 & 1.7 & 1.2 & 1.2 & 1.7 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”).

(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a  short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer  advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right  to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if  they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements."

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial  instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address  the financing needs of its customers and clients. The  contractual amount of these financial instruments  represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm  should the customer or client draw upon the commitment  or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the  guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently  fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most  of these commitments and guarantees have historically  been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without  being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total  contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the  Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit  exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion  of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  Firm’s related accounting policies.  \nTo provide for expected   credit losses in wholesale and  certain consumer lending-related commitments, an  allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments  is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information  regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related  commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts  and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related  financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  at June   30, 2022, and December   31, 2021. The amounts in  the table below for credit card, home equity and certain  scored business banking lending-related commitments  represent the total available credit for these products. The  Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all  available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at  the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card  and certain scored business banking lines of credit by  providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as  permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm  typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60  days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close  HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of  the underlying property, or when there has been a  demonstrable decline in the credit worthiness of the  borrower."

These legal proceedings are at varying stages  of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve  each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies  and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort  and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and  consumer protection claims), some of which present novel  legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of  reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves  established, for its legal proceedings is from   $\\S0$   to  approximately   $\\S1.2$   billion at June 30, 2022. This estimated  aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based  upon information available as of that date for those  proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of  reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters,  the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be  made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate  range of reasonably possible losses involves significant  judgment, given:\n\n \n• the number, variety and varying stages of the  proceedings, including the fact that many are in  \npreliminary stages, \n\n • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple  defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability  (if any) has yet to be determined, \n\n • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the  proceedings, including issues regarding class  certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \n\n • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential  outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm  has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the  court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or  incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,  and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be  a result which the Firm did not take into account in its  estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of  that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s  estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible  losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may  vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal  proceedings. \nAmrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is  investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in  connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by  two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase  entities into residential housing projects developed by the  Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”).   In 2017, numerous creditors  filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions  brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or  failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’  petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India  and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order  fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately   $\\S31.5$   million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.  Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued  an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and  other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities  and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,  violated certain currency control and money laundering  provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry  under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)  and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May  2020, the ED attached approximately  $\\S25$   million from J.P.  Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the  criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and  cooperating with the PMLA investigation.    \nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank,  N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the  Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major  international oil companies. The account held  approximately   $\\S1.1$   billion in connection with a dispute  among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the  settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid  out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in  accordance with directions received from its clients. In  November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)  commenced a claim in the English High Court for  approximately   $\\S875$   million in payments made out of the  accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were  instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank,  N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments  may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and  April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in  favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full.  The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision  relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately   $\\S75$    million. \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm  previously reported settlements with certain government  authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and  trading activities and controls related to those activities.  Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded  guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The  Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year  exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its  affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional  Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm  will need the Department of Labor to approve a further  exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year  disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only  remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa  Competition Commission matter which is currently pending  before the South Africa Competition Tribunal."

        "text": "With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New  York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a  consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,  which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws  based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign  exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of  persons who transacted in FX futures and options on  futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed  requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and  certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other  foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of  these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class  action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign  exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who  purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates.  Another putative class action was brought against the Firm  and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported  indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court  approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants  of that class action for a total of  $\\S10$   million. In addition,  some FX-related individual and putative class actions based  on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed  outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the  Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action  pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the  tribunal has denied a request by the proposed class  representatives for class certification on an opt-out basis.    \nInquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . In  December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered  into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures  Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective  civil investigations of compliance with records preservation  requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap  dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and  CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain  copies of certain communications required to be maintained  under their respective record keeping rules, where such  communications were sent or received by employees over  electronic messaging channels that had not been approved  for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also  included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan  Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found  related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P.  \nMorgan Securities LLC paid a  $\\S125$    million civil monetary  penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc  paid a total  $\\S75$    million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC.  The Firm continues to respond to requests for information  and other material from certain authorities concerning its  compliance with records preservation requirements in  connection with business communications sent over  electronic messaging channels that have not been approved  by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries. \nIn March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in  the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting  breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities  laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise  adequate oversight over compliance with records  preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages,  restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance  reforms. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. \nInterchange Litigation.  Groups of merchants and retail  associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging  that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,  conspired to set the price of credit and debit card  interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of  antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases  for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card  interchange, and modifications to certain credit card  network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that  settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded  to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  New York for further proceedings consistent with the  appellate decision. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate  actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other  seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the  parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement  which amends and supersedes the prior settlement  agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants  collectively contributed an additional  $\\S900$   million to the  approximately   $\\S5.3$   billion previously held in escrow from  the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended  settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.  Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval  order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the  percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended  class settlement,  $\\S700$   million has been returned to the  defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with  the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action  continues separately, and in September 2021, the District  Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in  part, and denied the motion in part. \nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions  raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as  well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those  actions remain pending."

        "text": "LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and  Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from  various governmental agencies and entities around the  world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s  (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for  various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s  Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss  Competition Commission’s investigation relating to  EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain  subject, continues. In December 2016, the European  Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other  banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules  relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that  decision with the European General Court, and that appeal  is pending. \nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along  with other banks in various individual and putative class  actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar  LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the  period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has  obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain  other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of  New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims  related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the  defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative  class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was  administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been  dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a  lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and  other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement  to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the  market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards.  Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In  December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a  preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from  setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial  instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s  settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc  LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the  Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill  Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. \nMetals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and  Related Inquiries.  The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions  with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,  collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective  investigations relating to historical trading practices by  former employees in the precious metals and U.S.  treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to  2016. \nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement  (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a  criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with  two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain  terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms  of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after  three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully  comply with all of their obligations.  \n\nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,  JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.  Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary  amount of approximately   $\\S920$    million. A portion of the  total monetary amount includes victim compensation  payments. \nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in  the United States District Court for the Southern District of  New York against the Firm and certain former employees,  alleging a precious metals futures and options price  manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity  Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust  enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the  General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court  consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022,  the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the  parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed  in the United States District Courts for the Northern District  of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the  Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and  options, and bringing claims under the Commodity  Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois  were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The  Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June  2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement  among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced  putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged  underlying conduct related to precious metals. \nIn October 2020, two putative class action complaints were  filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the  United States District Court for the Eastern District of New  York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on  behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the  putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the  Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not  disclose certain information relating to the above- referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these  putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their  second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally  alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures  contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during  the putative class period were materially false and  misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.   \nIn May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act  on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the  State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and  unjust enrichment claims against certain current and  former officers and directors of the Firm.  The complaint  claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the  shareholder’s demand to commence litigation and seeks"

        "text": "damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms  on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to  certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the  subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC  in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities  that were separately the subject of a resolution between  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,  Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are  named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New  York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust  law and New York State common law in connection with an  alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous  exchange trading for securities lending transactions.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.  Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which  defendants are opposing. \naccount its current litigation reserves and its estimated  aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal  proceedings currently pending against it should not have a  material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial  condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the  uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no  assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will  not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently  accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational  consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular  matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating  results for a particular period, depending on, among other  factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level  of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. \n# \nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed  above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as  defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial  number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has  meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its  currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to  defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may  be initiated from time to time in the future. \nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its  currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with  the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm  accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable  that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of  the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its  outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its  litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,  upward or downward, as appropriate, based on  management’s best judgment after consultation with  counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was  $\\S73$   million and   $\\S185$   million for the three months ended June 30, 2022  and 2021, respectively, and   $\\S192$   million and   $\\S Z13$   million  for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021,  respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation  reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.  \nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome  of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek  very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters  present novel legal theories, involve a large number of  parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot  state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of  the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate  resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or  consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase  believes, based upon its current knowledge and after  consultation with counsel, consideration of the material  legal proceedings described above and after taking into"

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major  reportable business segments - Consumer & Community  Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial  Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there  is a Corporate segment. The business segments are  determined based on the products and services provided, or  the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in  which financial information is currently evaluated by the  Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented  on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and  Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further  discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. \n# \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s  segment results as of or for the three and six months ended  June 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis.

Based on our reviews, we are not  aware of any material modifications that should be made to  the accompanying interim financial statements for them to  be in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America. \nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the  standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of  the Firm as of December   31, 2021, and the related  consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,  changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the  year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report  dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph  describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit  losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated  financial statements. In our opinion, the information set  forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  information as of December   31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all  material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance  sheet from which it has been derived.   \n# \nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of  the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm  registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be  independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with  the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and  the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with  the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial  information consists principally of applying analytical  procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for  financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in  scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the  standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the  expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements  taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an  opinion. \nAugust   3, 2022"

Services include  procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense  management services, and business-to-business payment  solutions. \nCredit derivatives :   Financial instruments whose value is  derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a  third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one  party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to  another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence  of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include,  among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its  obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the  reference entity, neither party has recourse to the  reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to  the protection seller for the difference between the face  value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of  settling the credit derivative contract.

Origination  date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual  appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the  origination date. \n# \nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current  estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated  collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home  price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area  (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist  of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data  where actual data is not available. As a result, the  estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do  not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;  as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise  and should therefore be viewed as estimates. \n# \nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well  as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV  ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. \nMacro businesses:  the macro businesses include Rates,  Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing  and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets. \nManaged basis:  A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide  financial results that includes reclassification s to present  revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.

Alt-A  lending characteristics may include one or more of the  following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;  (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)  a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial  proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a  borrower does not provide complete documentation of his  or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. \n# \nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the  option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only  or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option  ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the  introductory period. This introductory rate is usually  significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed  rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once  the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate  charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and  adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The  minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest  accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is  deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.  Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which  converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan  upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date  triggers. \nPrime \nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good  credit records who meet specific underwriting  requirements, including prescriptive requirements related  to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage  borrowers provide full documentation and generally have  reliable payment histories."

Loans (other than credit  card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.  government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status  when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,  regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and  interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more  unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of  collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically  maintained on nonaccrual status. \nNonperforming assets:  Nonperforming assets include  nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain  assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real  estate owned and other commercial and personal property. \nNSFR:  Net Stable Funding Ratio \nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  \nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss) \nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit \nOTC : “Over-the-counter derivatives”:   Derivative contracts  that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally  \nbetween two derivative counterparties, where one or both  counterparties is a derivatives dealer. \nOTC cleared : “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”:   Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed  bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing  house, such that each derivative counterparty is only  exposed to the default of that clearing house. \nOverhead ratio:  Noninterest expense as a percentage of  total net revenue. \n# \nParticipating securities:  represents unvested share-based  compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to  dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,  “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share  calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase  grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees  under its share-based compensation programs, which  entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends  during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the  dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested  awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under  the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and  undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock  and participating securities, based on their respective rights  to receive dividends. \nPCD:  “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent  acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition  have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in  credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. \nPillar 1:  The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar”  approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital  requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and  prescribes rules for calculating RWA. \nPillar 3:  The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar”  approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through  disclosure requirements which allow market participants to  assess the risk and capital profiles of banks. \nPPP:  Paycheck Protection Program under the Small  Business Association (“SBA”) \nPRA:  Prudential Regulation Authority \nPre-provision profit/(loss):  represents total net revenue  less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this  financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a  lending institution to generate income in excess of its  provision for credit losses. \nPrincipal transactions revenue :   Principal transactions  revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer  spread, which is the difference between the price at which  the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and  the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.  It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or  termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and  unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and  losses on financial and other instruments (including those  accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in  client-driven market-making activities and on private equity  investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity  instruments, derivatives and commodities (including  physical commodities inventories and financial instruments  that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue  also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and  losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives  designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships  (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign  exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk  management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and  foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives."
