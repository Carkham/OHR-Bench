Net interest income excluding Markets was   $\\S22.4$   billion, up   $63\\%$  . – Noninterest revenue was   $\\S19.5$   billion, up   $25\\%$  , driven  by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, higher  Markets noninterest revenue and the absence of losses  on equity investments in Payments in the prior year,  partially offset by higher net investment securities  losses in Treasury and CIO. The impact of the First  Republic acquisition included a  $\\S2.7$   billion estimated  bargain purchase gain in Corporate.  – Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower  Markets NII, largely offset by higher NIR. \n•  Noninterest expense  was  $\\S20.8$   billion, up  $11\\%$  , driven  by higher compensation expense due to additional  headcount and the impact of wage inflation,  $\\S599$   million  expense associated with the First Republic acquisition,  higher technology and marketing investments and higher  legal expense."

Net charge-offs increased  $\\S754$   million, predominantly  driven by CCB, primarily Card Services, as  $^{30+}$   day  delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.  The prior year included a  $\\S428$   million net addition to the  allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of   $\\S657$    million.\n\n • The total  allowance for credit losses  was  $\\S24.3$   billion at  June 30, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses  to retained loans coverage ratio of   $1.75\\%$  , compared  with   $1.69\\%$   in the prior year.\n\n •  The Firm’s  nonperforming assets  totaled  $\\S7.8$   billion at  June 30, 2023, relatively flat from the prior year, as  lower consumer nonaccrual loans due to loan sales in the  prior year were offset by higher wholesale nonaccrual  loans, reflecting client-specific downgrades. Refer to  Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 for additional  information.\n\n • Firmwide  average loans  of  $\\S1.2$   trillion were up   $13\\%$  ,  driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, largely as a result  of the First Republic acquisition. \n\n •  Firmwide  average deposits  of   $\\S2.4$   trillion were down   $6\\%$  ,   driven by:  – the continued migration into higher-yielding  investments in AWM; declines in CIB and CB primarily  due to continued deposit attrition, which for CIB  included actions to reduce certain deposits; and a net  decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to  increased customer spending, partially offset by – the impact of the First Republic acquisition in CCB, and  an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's  international consumer initiatives. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 for  additional information. \nSelected capital and other metrics\n\n •  CET1 capital  was  $\\S236$   billion, and the Standardized and  Advanced CET1 ratios were  $13.8\\%$   and   $13.9\\%$  ,  respectively.\n\n •  SLR  was  $5.8\\%$  .\n\n •  TBVPS  grew   $15\\%$  , ending the second quarter of 2023 at   $\\S79.90$  .\n\n • As of June 30, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-of-period  High Quality Liquid Assets  (“HQLA”) of approximately   $\\S792$   billion and  unencumbered marketable securities   with a fair value of approximately  $\\S620$   billion, resulting  in approximately   $\\S1.4$   trillion of liquidity sources.

        "text": "# \n•  Basel III Finalization: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve,  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and  the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based  capital framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule:  Amendments applicable to large banking organizations  and to banking organizations with significant trading  activity\". Under the proposal, changes would include  replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded  risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of  internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted  assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress  capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both  the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized  approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk- based capital requirements for all banks with assets of   $\\S100$   billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S.  global systemically important banks (\"GSIBs\"). The  proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year  transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based  approach.\n\n \n• GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also  released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB  surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments  would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an  annual basis, using the average of the quarterly  surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with  daily averaging required for certain measures within the  surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be  reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be  other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation.  The proposed amendments would revise risk-based  capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs,  and would become effective on two calendar quarters  after the adoption of the final rule. \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 for  additional information. \n# \nThese current expectations are forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform  Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on  the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s  management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q,  and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to  Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 10-Q;  Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form  10-K; and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this  Form 10-Q for a further discussion of certain of those risks  and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause  JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because  of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that  actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook  information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake  to update any forward-looking statements. \nJPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should  be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.  economies,   financial markets activity, the geopolitical  environment, the competitive environment, client and  customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative  developments in the U.S. and other countries where the  Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the  performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make  appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in  response to ongoing developments in the business,  economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it  operates. \nIn May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed  rulemaking recommending a special assessment related to  the systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023,  to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (\"DIF\")  arising from the protection of uninsured depositors  resulting from recent bank resolutions. In its current form,  the rule would impose a special assessment at an annual  rate of 12.5 basis points on certain banks’ estimated  uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. If  this rule is finalized as proposed, the Firm expects to  recognize an estimated assessment expense of  approximately   $\\S3$   billion (pre-tax) in the quarter in which  the rule is finalized, which is expected to occur in the  second half of 2023. \n# \n•  Management expects both net interest income and net  interest income excluding Markets to be approximately   $\\S87$   billion, market dependent.\n\n • Management expects adjusted expense to be  approximately   $\\S84.5$   billion, market dependent and  excluding any FDIC special assessment.\n\n • Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card  Services to be approximately  $2.6\\%$  . Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted  expense are non-GAAP financial measures.

In connection with  the First Republic acquisition, the Firm issued a five-year,   $\\S50$   billion secured note to the FDIC (the \"Purchase Money  Note\"), and entered into shared-loss agreements with the  FDIC with respect to certain loans acquired and lending- related commitments assumed in the acquisition. Refer to  Note 28 for additional information. \nJPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of  and for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect the impact  of the First Republic acquisition. Where meaningful to the  disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition is  disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-Q. The Firm  continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate  clients, products and services, associated with the First  Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and  operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which  segments certain clients, products and services associated  with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits,  should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications  and allocations may change in future periods, including  across the Firm's segments. \nInterbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition \nThe publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S.  dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six- month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023  (“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and six- month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be  published on a \"synthetic\" basis, which will allow market  participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR- linked contracts through September 30, 2024. \nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully  converted predominantly all of its cleared derivatives  contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of initiatives by the  principal central counterparties   $\\mathsf{\\left(\"C C P S\"\\right)}$   to convert cleared  derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s  other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained  outstanding at LIBOR Cessation will be remediated through  contractual fallback provisions or through the framework  provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act  (“LIBOR Act”). The Firm continues its client outreach  activities with respect to the limited amount of contracts  that continue to reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR in  order to complete remediation by September 30, 2024.

These risk  factors include potential impacts to the Firm associated  with current market and economic conditions, including  inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and geopolitical  tensions (including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine),  any or all of which could result in additional market  disruption, government actions (including with respect to  monetary policies), ongoing impacts to global supply  chains, and other geopolitical risks."

        "text": "The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major  reportable business segments – Consumer & Community  Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial  Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there  is a Corporate segment. \nThe business segments are determined based on the  products and services provided, or the type of customer  served, and they reflect the manner in which financial  information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating  Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed  basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s  use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a  definition of managed basis. \nDescription of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present  each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The  management reporting process that derives business  segment results includes the allocation of certain income  and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the  assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications  used for segment reporting, and further refinements may  be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses  the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an  annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business  metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and  analysts in assessing performance.  \nForeign exchange risk \nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and  Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues  and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks  centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate  movements related to the transferred risk in its results.  Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89 for  additional information. \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is  referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions,  judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are  reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the  LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated  its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact  of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business  equity on page 51, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. \nRefer to Business Segment Results – Description of business  segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note  32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further  discussion of those methodologies. \nRevenue sharing  \nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and  services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the  participating business segments may agree to share  revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally  recognized in the segment responsible for the related  product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s)  involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect  these revenue-sharing agreements. \nFunds transfer pricing  \nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the  Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and  Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk  and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.  \nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest  rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and  liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the  methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process  are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other  factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest  income to the segments."

        "text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business  activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale  loan, advises customers and clients on their investment  decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other  products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.  The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and  the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the  interests of its clients, customers and investors, and  protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.  \nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires,  among other things: \n\n \n• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and  escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; \n\n • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and  management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and \n\n • A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.  \nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation  framework with strong internal governance and  independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the  “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully  considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and  incentive compensation processes.  \nRisk governance and oversight functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2022  Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight  functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s  business activities. \n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline \n& \\textbf{Form 10-Q} & \\textbf{Form 10-K}\\\\\n& \\textbf{page} & \\textbf{page} \\\\\n\\textbf{Risk governance and oversight functions} & \\textbf{reference} & \\textbf{reference} \\\\\n\\hline \nStrategic Risk & & 85 \\\\\nCapital Risk & 48-53 & 86-96 \\\\\nLiquidity Risk & 54-61 & 97-104 \\\\\nReputation Risk & & 105 \\\\\nConsumer Credit Risk & 65-69 & 110-115 \\\\\nWholesale Credit Risk & 70-79 & 116-126 \\\\\nInvestment Portfolio Risk & 83 & 130 \\\\\nMarket Risk & 84-89 & 131-138 \\\\\nCountry Risk & 90 & 139-140 \\\\\nClimate Risk & & 141 \\\\\nOperational Risk & & 142-148 \\\\\nCompliance Risk & & 145 \\\\\nConduct Risk & & 146 \\\\\nLegal Risk & & 147 \\\\\n\\textbf{Estimations and Model Risk} & & 148 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n# \nThe Firm’s risk governance framework involves  understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of  risks. \n\\begin{tabular}{|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\arraybackslash}c|>{\\serieslength}c}\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\\textbf{The Firm's risk governance and oversight functions align to:}} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Factors that cause a risk to exist} & \\textbf{Types of Risks by which risks manifest themselves} & \\textbf{Impacts of Risks Consequences of Risks, both quantitative and qualitative} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\nRefer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management  governance and oversight."

        "text": "Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or  composition of capital to support the Firm’s business  activities and associated risks during normal economic  environments and under stressed conditions.  \nRefer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10- K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3  Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available  on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s  capital risk. \n# \nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital  ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and  internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies  (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured  depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of  regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is  determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (\"RWA\"),  which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet  exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive  approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a  standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an  advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the  risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is  evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or  Advanced approaches compared to their respective  regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III  Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding  than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.  \nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced  Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to  calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51 for additional  information. \nKey Regulatory Developments \nCECL regulatory capital transition \nBeginning January 1, 2022, the  $\\S2.9$    billion CECL capital  benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at  $25\\%$   per year  over a three-year period. As of June   30, 2023, the Firm's  CET1 capital reflected the remaining   $\\S1.4$    billion benefit  associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. \nRisk-based Capital Targets \nThe Firm’s target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital  ratio for the first quarter of 2024 remains at  $13.5\\%$  . The  Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from the target  dependent on market conditions. The target is based on the  Basel III capital rules currently in effect. \n# \nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC  released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital  framework, entitled \"Regulatory capital rule: Amendments  applicable to large banking organizations and to banking  organizations with significant trading activity\". Under the  proposal, changes would include replacement of the  advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach,  which would not permit the use of internal models for the  calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market  risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would  be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach  and the standardized approach. The proposal would  significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all  banks with assets of   $\\S100$   billion or more, including the  Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is  July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable  to the expanded risk-based approach. \n# \nIn July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal  to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted  as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to  assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the  average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout  the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain  measures within the surcharge calculation.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA was further  impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by higher  average loans, a dividend payment to the Parent Company,  and a decline in average deposits. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three  months ended June   30, 2023 decreased when compared  with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease  in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a  reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and  loan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA- eligible investment securities and the impact of the First  Republic acquisition.  \nRefer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on  the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First  Republic acquisition. \nActions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor  behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits,  including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate  from period to period due to changes in their respective  eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of  ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of  Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.  \nRefer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and  the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional  information on HQLA and net cash outflows. \n# \nThe Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing   that is  intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal  entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse  scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s  resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios  are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are  performed in response to specific market events or  concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the  formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its  liquidity position. \nThe Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the  Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating  subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk  tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to  manage through periods of stress when access to normal  funding sources may be disrupted."

These instruments are secured predominantly  by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.  Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased  at June   30, 2023, compared with December   31, 2022, due  to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact  of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making  activities in Markets. \nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold  under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to  investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s  demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix  of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured  financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.  \nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding  primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial  paper and other borrowed funds.  \nThe decrease in commercial paper at June   30, 2023 from  December 31, 2022, and for the average three and six  months ended June   30, 2023 compared to the prior year  periods, was due to lower net issuance levels resulting from  short-term liquidity management. \nThe decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds  for the three and six months ended June   30, 2023  compared to the prior year periods was due to a lower level  of overdrafts as well as net maturities of structured notes  classified as other borrowed funds in CIB."

        "text": "# \nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan  is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term  funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm  evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.  \nThe significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in  support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries.

Reductions in these ratings could have an  adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,  increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or  funding requirements and decrease the number of investors  and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature  and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades  depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,  which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk  and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it  maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential  decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

        "text": "# \n# \nLoans increased compared to December   31, 2022 driven  by residential real estate loans associated with the First  Republic acquisition and higher auto loans. \nResidential real estate:   The residential real estate  portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair  value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and  home equity lines of credit. \nRetained loans increased compared to December   31, 2022,  reflecting residential real estate loans associated with the  First Republic acquisition. Retained nonaccrual loans  decreased compared to December   31, 2022. Net recoveries  were lower for the three and six months ended June   30,  2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year  driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates.  \nLoans at fair value decreased from December   31, 2022,  driven by a decrease in CIB due to sales outpacing  purchases largely offset by an increase in Home Lending as  originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual  loans at fair value were relatively flat compared to  December   31, 2022. \nAt June   30, 2023 and December   31, 2022, the carrying  value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was  $\\S90.0$    billion and  $\\S36.3$   billion, respectively. The increase was  driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.   These loans have an interest-only payment period generally  followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing  payment period to maturity and are typically originated as  higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The  credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the  performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio and  there were no charge-offs associated with the First Republic  acquisition. \nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit  outstanding was  $\\S16.9$   billion at June   30, 2023, which  included   $\\S2.6$   billion associated with the First Republic  acquisition. The carrying value of home equity lines of  credit outstanding included  $\\S4.6$   billion of HELOCs that  have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments  or have been modified and  $\\S4.7$   billion of interest-only  balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The  Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving  period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent  permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material  deterioration in their credit risk profile. \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s  residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed  by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for- sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure  to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related  to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in  estimating the allowance for loan losses. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{June 30, December 31,}\\\\\n(in millions) &   \\multicolumn{1}{c}{2023} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{2022} &\\\\\n\\hline \nCurrent               &     \\$~&    614~&   $659$~\\\\\n30-89 days past due  &     &  112~&  $136$~\\\\\n90 or more days past due&     &  215~& $302$~\\\\\n\\hline \nTotal government guaranteed loans &     \\$~&   941~&  $1,097$~\\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n# \nAt June   30, 2023,  $\\S229.8$   billion, or   $70\\%$   of the total  retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was  concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and  Massachusetts, compared with  $\\S147.8$   billion, or   $62\\%$   at  December   31, 2022.  \nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic  composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s  residential real estate loans. \n# \nFor the three and six months ended June   30, 2023,  residential real estate FDMs were  $\\S35$   million and   $\\S75$    million, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had   $\\S33$   million and  $\\S48$   million of loans subject to trial  modification where the terms of the loans have not been  permanently modified, as well as  $\\S3$   million and  $\\S5$   million  of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy  proceedings (\"Chapter 7 loans\") for the three and six  months ended June   30, 2023, respectively. The changes to  the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR  reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria.  Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were  considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note  12 for further information. \nFor the three and six months ended June   30, 2022,  residential real estate TDRs were  $\\S115$   million and  $\\S Z33$  million, respectively.

        "text": "# \nTotal credit card loans increased from December   31, 2022  reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving  balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic  levels. The June   30,   $^{2023}\\,30+$   and  $^{90+}$   day delinquency  rates of   $1.70\\%$   and  $0.84\\%$  , respectively, increased  compared to the December   31,  $^{2022}\\,^{30+}$   and   $^{90+}$   day  delinquency rates of   $1.45\\%$   and   $0.68\\%$   respectively, and  net charge-offs increased for the three and six months  ended June   30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the  prior year as   $^{30+}$   day delinquencies have normalized.  \nConsistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans  typically remain on accrual status until charged off.  However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the  estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed  interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further  information about this portfolio, including information  about delinquencies. \nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and  FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans. \nModifications of credit card loans \nFor the three and six months ended June   30, 2023, credit  card FDMs were  $\\S181$   million and  $\\S326$   million,  respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had  $\\S26$    million of loans subject to trial modification where the  terms of the loans have not been permanently modified for  both the three and six months ended June   30, 2023. The  changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR  reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria.  Accordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs, but  not FDMs. \nFor the three and six months ended June   30, 2022, credit  card TDRs were  $\\S81$   million and   $\\S163$   million, respectively.

        "text": "In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit  risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and  counterparties, as well as through various operating  services (such as cash management and clearing activities),  securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A  portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s  wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance  sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the  loans that it originates into the market as part of its  syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio  concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is  actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth  reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure  inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,  product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry  discussion on pages 72-75 for further information. \nThe Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held  in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM  and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the  wholesale methodology is applied when determining the  allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert  certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and  services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to  align with the Firm’s businesses and operations.  Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk  rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in  future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 9  for additional information. \nAs of June   30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming  exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific  downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction  in lending-related commitments. For the six months ended  June   30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low,  despite an increase in charge-offs in the second quarter of  2023 concentrated in Office real estate. \nAs of June   30, 2023, retained loans increased   $\\S64.5$   billion  predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic  acquisition. Lending-related commitments increased  $\\S69.1$    billion driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition,  and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an  increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing  portfolio. \nWholesale credit portfolio \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Credit exposure} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Nonperforming} \\\\\n\\cline{2-3} \\cline{4-5}\n(in millions) & \\textbf{Jun 30, 2023} & Dec 31, 2022 & \\textbf{Jun 30, 2023} & Dec  31, 2022 \\\\\n\\hline \nLoans retained & \\$ 668,145 & \\$ 603,670 & \\$ 2,593 & \\$ 1,963 \\\\\nLoans held-for-sale & 5,043 & 3,352 & 48 & 26 \\\\\nLoans at fair value & 27,329 & 32,075 & 367 & 406 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Loans} & 700,517 & 639,097 & \\textbf{3,008} & 2,395 \\\\\nDerivative's &  &  &  &  \\\\\nreceivables & 64,217 & 70,880 & \\textbf{286} & 296 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Receivables from} &  &  &  &  \\\\\ncustomers' (a) & 42,741 & 49,257 & -- & -- \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total wholesale} &  &  &  &  \\\\\ncredit-related &  &  &  &  \\\\\nassets & 807,475 & 759,234 & \\textbf{3,294} & 2,691 \\\\\n\\textbf{Assets acquired in} &  &  &  &  \\\\\nloan satisfactions &  &  &  &  \\\\\nReal estate owned & -- & NA & \\textbf{117} & 74 \\\\\nOther & -- & NA & -- & -- \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total assets} &  &  &  &  \\\\\nacquired in loan &  &  &  &  \\\\\nsatisfactions & -- & NA & \\textbf{117} & 74 \\\\\n\\textbf{Lending-related} &  &  &  &  \\\\\ncommitments & 541,089 & 471,980 & \\textbf{332} & 455 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total wholesale} &  &  &  & \\\\\ncredit portfolio & \\$1,348,564 & (\\textdollar{}) \\$1,231,214 & \\textbf{3,743} & \\$ 3,220 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Credit derivatives} &  &  &  &  \\\\\nand credit-related &  &  &  &  \\\\\nnotes used in &  &  &  &  \\\\\ncredit portfolio &  &  &  &  \\\\\nmanagement &  &  &  &  \\\\\nactivities\\textsuperscript{(b)} & \\$ (31,105) & \\$ (18,143) & \\$ & -- \\textsuperscript{(b)} \\\\\n\\textbf{Liquid securities and} &  &  &  &  \\\\\nother cash &  &  &  &  \\\\\ncollateral held &  &  &  &  \\\\\nagainst derivatives & (23,282) & (23,014) & -- & NA \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans  to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM; these are reported within  accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance  sheets.\n\n (b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold  through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage  both performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these  derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

        "text": "# \nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as  commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and  guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.  The contractual amounts of these financial instruments  represent the maximum possible credit risk should the  clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm  fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the  clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms  of these contracts. Most of these commitments and  guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,  cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default  occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the  total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related  commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected  future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to  Note 24 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments. \n# \nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment  margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that  are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’  brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and  readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of  this collateral iz ation, no allowance for credit losses is  generally held against these receivables. To manage its  credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and  monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,  and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other  collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These  receivables are reported within accrued interest and  accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance  sheets. \n# \nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage  risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations  in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and  commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives  in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to  manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions  from its market-making activities, including the  counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.  The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its  own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature  of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the  derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is  exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives the Firm  is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.  For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures  and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”)  derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk  of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”).  Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk  exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use  of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and  collateral agreements.  \nThe percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative  transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding  foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically  covered by collateral agreements due to their short  maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily  — was approximately  $88\\%$   and  $87\\%$   at June   30, 2023, and  December   31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for  additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral  agreements and for a further discussion of derivative  contracts, counterparties and settlement types. \nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the  Consolidated balance sheets was  $\\S64.2$   billion and  $\\S70.9$    billion at June   30, 2023, and December   31, 2022,  respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market  movements in CIB Markets. Derivative receivables represent  the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect  to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the  related cash collateral held by the Firm.  \nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash  collateral that may be used as security when the fair value  of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these  purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent  with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in  the LCR rule.  \nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of current  credit risk should also take into consideration other  collateral, which generally represents securities that do not  qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The  benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each  counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master  netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the  derivative receivables for each counterparty. \nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7  government securities, other liquid government agency and  guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity  securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of  transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that  have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm  has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the  reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the  balances and is not included in the tables below, it is  available as security against potential exposure that could  arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative  contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for  additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral  agreements for derivatives transactions."

The allowance for credit  losses generally consists of:\n\n \n• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n\n • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is  reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the  Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\n • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,  which is reflected in investment securities on the  Consolidated balance sheets. \n# \nThe allowance for credit losses as of June   30, 2023 was   $\\S24.3$   billion, reflecting a net addition of   $\\S2.7$   billion from  December   31, 2022.  \nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses included   $\\S1.5$   billion, consisting of: \n•   $\\S819$   million in  wholesale , predominantly driven by  net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions  related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter  of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed  on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023,  and •   $\\S649$   million in  consumer , predominantly driven by  Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of  changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,  including the impact from the weighted average U.S.  unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of  2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse  scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset  by reduced borrower uncertainty.  \nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.  unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:  \n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline \n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\textbf{Assumptions at June 30, 2023}} \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n & \\textbf{4Q23} & \\textbf{2Q24} & \\textbf{4Q24} \\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. unemployment rate$^{(\\text{a})}$ & 4.2 \\% & 4.9 \\% & 5.0 \\% \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP$^{(\\text{b})}$ & 0.5 \\% & -- \\% & 1.0 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multicolumn{1}{l}{} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{} \\\\\n\\hline \n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\textbf{}} & \\textbf{} & \\textbf{} & \\textbf{} \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n & \\textbf{2Q23} & \\textbf{4Q23} & \\textbf{2Q24}\\\\\n\\hline \nU.S. unemployment rate$^{(\\text{a})}$ & 3.8 \\% & 4.3 \\% & 5.0 \\% \\\\\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP$^{(b)}$ & 1.5 \\% & 0.4 \\% & -- \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.

Refer to Note  1 for further information. \nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a  weighted average of five internally developed  macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios  incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the  central case assumptions provided in the table below,  resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate  peaking at   $5.8\\%$   in the third quarter of 2024, and a  $1.5\\%$    lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024."

At June   30, 2023, the Treasury  and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the  allowance for credit losses, was   $\\S610.2$   billion, and the  average credit rating of the securities comprising the  portfolio was  $\\mathsf{A A}+$   (based upon external ratings where  available, and where not available, based primarily upon  internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on  pages 45-46 and Note 10 for further information on the  investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.  Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 for  further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market  Risk Management on pages 84-89 for further information  on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.  \n# \nPrincipal investments are typically privately-held financial  instruments representing ownership interests or other  forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments  include tax-oriented investments and investments made to  enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and  exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance  sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing  businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The  Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and  Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial  results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in  line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to  support underserved communities and minority-owned  businesses. \nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of  the principal investment portfolios as of June   30, 2023 and  December   31, 2022.\n\n \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\hline \n & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{June 30,} & December 31, & \\\\\n(in billions) & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{2023} & 2022 \\\\\n\\hline \nTax-oriented investments, primarily in & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textdollar{} } & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textdollar{} } \\\\\nalternative energy and affordable & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\textdollar{} } & \\multIColumn{2}{c}{\\textdollar{} } \\\\\nhousing$^{(\\textit{a})}$ & \\$ & 27.5 & \\$ & 26.2 \\\\\nPrivate equity, various debt and equity &  &  &  &  \\\\\ninstruments, and real assets$^{(\\textit{b})}$ & 11.4 &  &  & 10.8 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total carrying value} & \\$ & 38.9 & \\$ & 37.0 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) As of June 30, 2023, included approximately   $\\S1.2$   billion in tax- oriented investments in CIB associated with the First Republic  acquisition.\n\n (b) Includes the Firm’s  $40\\%$   ownership in C6 Bank and  $49\\%$   ownership in  Viva Wallet. \nRefer to page 130 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk  Management governance and oversight."

The Firm  has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating  Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.   \nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a  one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss  methodology which approximates a  $95\\%$   confidence level.  For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this  methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely  aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs  and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,  provides the appropriate information needed to respond to  risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily  aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules  (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s  regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.  The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling  techniques and measurements, and other factors.

        "text": "# \nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported  net income is important as interest rate risk represents one  of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk  arises not only from trading activities but also from the  Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include  extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits,  issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. \nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate  risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates  the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate  scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which  includes net interest income and certain interest rate  sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and  in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm  conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest  rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.  dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).  These simulations primarily include retained loans,  deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds  transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR  and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page  132 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to  a net interest income baseline, over the following 12  months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios  include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term  and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield  curve involving holding short-term rates constant and  increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve  involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term  rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and  decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many  different factors, including:\n\n \n• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous  changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n\n • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled  prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding  assumptions about actions that could be taken by the  Firm or its clients and customers in response to  instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment  assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the  scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,  the time since origination, and other factors which are  updated periodically based on historical experience.  Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's  earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain  assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative  Easing that are highly uncertain and require management  judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held  by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by  actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary  policy, including through the use of the Reverse  Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors  that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such  as the level of loans across the industry and competition  for deposits. \n\n•  The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit  betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid  could change upon a given change in market interest  rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and  periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk  calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second  quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags  impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The  model change incorporated observed pricing and  customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate  environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from  the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer  behavior and competition for deposits. \nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically  evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the  composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market  conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and  other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s  interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does  not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income.  Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information. \nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table  below. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\makecell{June 30,\\\\2023} & \\makecell{December 31,\\\\2022} &  \\\\\n(in billions) & & & \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Parallel shift:} \\\\\n+100 bps shift in rates & \\$ & 2.5 & \\$ & (2.0)\\\\\n-100 bps shift in rates & & (2.2) & & 2.4 \\\\\n\\textbf{Steeper yield curve:} \\\\\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates & 0.6 & & 0.8 \\\\\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates & (1.6) & & 3.2 \\\\\n\\textbf{Flatter yield curve:} \\\\\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates & 1.8 & & (2.8) \\\\\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates & (0.6) & & (0.9) \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model update to  incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior periods have not been  revised. \nIn the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit  repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S.  dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023, would have been  lower by  $\\S4.2$   billion to the  $+100$   basis points shift in short- term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by  $\\S4.4$   billion  to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate  scenarios. \nIn addition, the change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities  as of June   30, 2023 compared to December   31, 2022   reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet  including the impact of the First Republic acquisition. \nAs of June   30, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to the  $+/{\\cdot}100$    basis points parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a  greater impact from assets repricing compared to the  impact of liabilities repricing."

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates  are integral to understanding its reported results. The  Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require  management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate  carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has  established policies and control procedures intended to  ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments  made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,  independently reviewed and applied consistently from  period to period. The methods used and judgments made  reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or  liabilities and the related business and risk management  strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are  intended to ensure that the process for changing  methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm  believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of  its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a  brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates  involving significant judgments. \n# \nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents  management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the  remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets  measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet  lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit  losses generally consists of:\n\n \n• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s  retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated).\n\n \n• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which is  reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the  Consolidated balance sheets, and\n\n \n• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities,  which is reflected in investment securities on the  Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant  judgment on a number of matters including development  and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of  historical loss experience, assessment of risk  characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of  collateral, and the determination of remaining expected  life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's  2022 Form 10-K for further information on these  judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies  used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;  and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82 and  Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information. \nOne of the most significant judgments involved in  estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to  the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses  over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s  methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates  hundreds of macroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are  relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit  losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty  variables. The specific variables that have the greatest  effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by  portfolio and geography.\n\n • Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S.  unemployment and HPI.\n\n • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.  unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.  interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,  commercial real estate prices and HPI. \n\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of  economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of  expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet  date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one  reporting period to the next. \nAs a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm  recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans  acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of  May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating  methodologies for the First Republic Portfolio, and the  ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance  for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was  measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm  with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled  estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is  excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis  below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all  of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s  modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is  predominantly residential real estate that has more  commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to  value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in  the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 28 for  additional information on the First Republic acquisition.  It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one  factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit  losses because management considers a wide variety of  factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit  losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may  not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across  all geographies or product types, and changes in factors  and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that  improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration  in others. \nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate  macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled  credit losses determined using its central and relative  adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five  scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan  losses and lending-related commitments. The central and  relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of  MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of  those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. \nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario  shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative  adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment  rate, averaging approximately   $1.6\\%$   higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of  $2.2\\%$   in the first quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining  approximately   $3.1\\%$   lower at the end of the eight-quarter  forecast, with a peak difference of approximately   $3.4\\%$   in  the third quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with a  peak difference of approximately   $10.5\\%$   in the first quarter  of 2025. This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future  changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of  reasons, including:\n\n • The allowance as of June   30, 2023, reflects credit losses  beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to  the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n\n • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both  interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis  cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes  in macroeconomic variables. \n\n • Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition  and borrower behavior can significantly affect the  allowance for credit losses."

        "text": "To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to  macroeconomic forecasts as of June   30, 2023, the Firm  compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse  scenario to its central scenario. Without considering  offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative  components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the  comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures  below reflect the following differences:\n\n \n• An increase of approximately  $\\S750$   million for residential  real estate loans and lending-related commitments,  including the First Republic portfolios\n\n • An increase of approximately  $\\S2.4$   billion for credit card  loans\n\n ▪ An increase of approximately  $\\S3.8$   billion for wholesale  loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the  First Republic portfolios.  \nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss  estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the  overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any  potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative  calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment  management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates  to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled  lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances  and conditions. \nFair value \nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities  at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are  measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including  derivatives, structured note products and certain securities  financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are  measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including  certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the  carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying  collateral. \nAssets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at  fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified  within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for  further information. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n\\textbf{June 30, 2023} & \\textbf{Total assets at} & \\textbf{Total level 3} \\\\\n(in millions, except ratios) & \\textbf{fair value} & \\textbf{assets} \\\\\n\\hline \nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements & \\$ 322,579 & \\$ -- \\\\\nSecurities borrowed & 55,905 & -- \\\\\nTrading assets: & & \\\\\n\\quad Trading-debt and equity instruments & 572,739 & 3,313 \\\\\n\\quad Derivative receivables$^{\\text{(a)}}$ & 64,217 & 10,749 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total trading assets} & 636,956 & 14,062 \\\\\n\\hline \nAFS securities & 203,262 & 267 \\\\\nLoans & 38,789 & 3,808 \\\\\nMSRs & 8,229 & 8,229 \\\\\nOther & 13,250 & 417 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis} & 1,278,970 & 26,783 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis} & 1,936 & 1,126 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total assets measured at fair value} & \\$1,280,906 & \\$ 27,909 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total Firm assets} & \\$3,868,240 & & \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets$^{\\text{(a)}}$} & & 0.7 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage  of total Firm assets at fair value$^{\\text{(a)}}$} & & & 2.2 \\% \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total  reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the  $\\S10.7$   billion  of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the  netting adjustment   as such netting is not relevant to a presentation  based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The  level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including  the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. \nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are  inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent  economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to  consider the available information and associated risks and  uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its  estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and  appropriate for the period ended June   30, 2023."

        "text": "Valuation \nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment.  The type and level of judgment required is largely  dependent on the amount of observable market information  available to the Firm. For instruments valued using  internally developed valuation models and other valuation  techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are  therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value  hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more  significant than those required when estimating the fair  value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. \nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument  within level 3, management must first determine the  appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to  use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant  inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical  data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,  transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment  speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such  as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of  comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit  curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the  valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable  inputs used. \nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management  judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of  valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,  the Firm’s credit worthiness, market funding rates, liquidity  considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios  that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk  position. The judgments made are typically affected by the  type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the  level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a  whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and  uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider  variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for  positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further  discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. \n# \nThe credit card rewards liability was  $\\S12.2$   billion and   $\\S11.3$   billion at June   30, 2023 and December   31, 2022,  respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other  liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase  in the liability was predominantly driven by continued  growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and  promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout  2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain  reward program terms in the second quarter. Refer to  pages 151-152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a  description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities,  associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. \n# \nRefer to Income taxes on page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s  2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with  the accounting for income taxes. \n# \nManagement applies significant judgment when testing  goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on  page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a  description of the significant valuation judgments  associated with goodwill impairment. \nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill,  including the goodwill impairment assessment as of  June   30, 2023. \n# \nRefer to Note 26 of this Form 10-Q, and Note  30  of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant  estimates and judgments associated with establishing  litigation reserves. \nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or  other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded  for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm  believes its valuation methods are appropriate and  consistent with those of other market participants, the  methods and assumptions used reflect management  judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and  portfolios. \nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in  the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or  assumptions different than those used by the Firm could  result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting  date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s  valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of  fair value for individual financial instruments."

        "text": "# \n# \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a  financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law  in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the  U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in  investment banking, financial services for consumers and  small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction  processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023,  JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed  certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic  acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain  operations, and to integrate clients, products and services,  associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with  the Firm’s businesses and operations. The Firm also  continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients,  products and services associated with the First Republic  acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated.  Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may  change in future periods including across the Firm's  segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the  Firm’s business segments and Note 28 for additional  information on the First Republic acquisition.  \nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan  Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the  accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by  regulatory authorities.  \nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared  in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual  results could be different from these estimates. In the  opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments  have been included such that this interim financial  information is fairly stated. \nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should  be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated  Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in  JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been  revised to conform with the current presentation.  \n# \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts  of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has  a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by  the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not  included on the Consolidated balance sheets. \nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial  interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is  a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.  \nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form  10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s  accounting policies regarding consolidation. \n# \nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables  and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the  related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net  basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally  enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP  also permits securities financing balances to be presented  on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including  the existence of a legally enforceable master netting  agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances  where it has determined that the specified conditions are  met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.   \n# \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge  a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the  portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be  included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of  the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This  guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be  used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and  disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting  adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm  elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate  those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon  adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained  earnings was not material. \nRefer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. \n# \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting  and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the  requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted  cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a  non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to  troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for  these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post- modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre- modification effective interest rate."

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s  2022 Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-based  allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance  approach. \nThis guidance was adopted under the modified  retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to  the allowance for credit losses of  $\\S587$    million and an  increase to retained earnings of   $\\S446$    million, after-tax,  predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit  card. \nThe adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure  requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess  whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a  concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan  modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty  consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction,  other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a  combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined  these types of modifications as financial difficulty  modifications (\"FDMs\"). As a result of the elimination of the  requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably  expected or involves a concession, the population of loans  considered FDMs will differ from those previously  considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of  current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination  year.  \nRefer to Note 12 for further information."

Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not  applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities  inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities  approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further  discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have  been included in each period presented."

        "text": "(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). \n\n (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be  classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June   30, 2023, and December   31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,  private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were  $\\S956$   million and  $\\S950$   million, respectively. Included in these balances at June   December    $\\S40$   million and   $\\S43$   million, respectively, and other assets of  $\\S916$   million and  $\\S907$   million, respectively.\n\n (e) At June      $\\S9.3$   billion and  $\\S9.7$   billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and  $\\S6.8$   billion of  commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.  GSEs and government agencies of  $\\S3.3$   billion and  $\\S2.4$   billion, respectively.\n\n (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid  when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit  associated with cash collateral. \n# \nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for  further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a  detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for  individual financial instruments.  \nThe following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3  financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to  measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the  significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for  those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of  such inputs. While the determination to classify an  instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the  unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,  level 3 financial instruments typically include observable  components (that is, components that are actively quoted  and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the  unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs  are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages  the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial  instruments using securities and derivative positions that  are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  \nThe range of values presented in the table is representative  of the highest and lowest level input used to value the  significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted  averages of the input values presented in the table are  calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that  the input is being used to value.  \nIn the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic  average values do not reflect the degree of input  uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the  Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the  characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm  and the relative distribution of instruments within the range  of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may  have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation  uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied  volatility levels because the option contracts have different  underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and  weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the  characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each  balance sheet date."

When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price- based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of  $\\S100$  .\n\n (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n\n (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used."

        "text": "Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a  discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in  unobservable inputs and the relationships between  unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of  the underlying instruments and external market factors that  affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s  positions.  \nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the  Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in  fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm  within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three  months ended June   30, 2023 and 2022. When a  determination is made to classify a financial instrument  within level 3, the determination is based on the  significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair  value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments  typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3  components, observable components (that is, components  that are actively quoted and can be validated to external  sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table  below include changes in fair value due in part to  observable factors that are part of the valuation  methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable  components of level 3 financial instruments using securities  and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or  2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2  risk management instruments are not included below, the  gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the  effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to  such level 3 instruments."

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different  rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for  private equity direct investments.  \nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of  June 30,  2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the  periods presented for those securities with observable price changes.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were  $\\S1.5$   billion.    (c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were  $\\S(1.0)$   billion. \nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”).  These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”)  at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. On June 29, 2023, Visa filed a  Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from  1.5991 to 1.5902 effective June 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments  related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters  may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June   30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding  when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will  be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to  Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. \nIn connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the  shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative  instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make  periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue  as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value  using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of  the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in  other income. As of June   30, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23   million Visa B shares that the Firm  had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions."

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying  value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected  life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including  credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

Because of this  collateral iz ation, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin  requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce  positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives,  including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments;  and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for  certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of  $\\S(30)$    million and the portfolio  layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of   $\\S(865)$   million at June   for credit losses of  $\\S(74)$    million at June   (c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The  estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, seven years for  agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

The financial effects of the FDMs,  which were largely in the form of term extensions and  interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted- average life of the loans by 15 years and 18 years, and  reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate  from  $6.90\\%$   to  $4.21\\%$   and  $6.75\\%$   to  $4.01\\%$   for the three  and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

Accordingly, trial modifications and  Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.  \nFor periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications  of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted  concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial  difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as  TDRs. For the three and six months ended June   30, 2022,  new TDRs were   $\\S115$    million and  $\\S Z33$    million,  respectively.

If a DCF methodology is  still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must  be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of  the pre-modification effective interest rate.  \nThe Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance  approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance  approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all  portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual  risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance  approach will continue to apply. \nThis guidance was adopted under the modified  retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to  the allowance for credit losses of  $\\S587$    million and an  increase to retained earnings of   $\\S446$    million, after-tax  predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit  card. \nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for  a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and  the related accounting policies."

These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the  analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the  quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not  have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most  significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a  variable interest that could potentially be significant, the  Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records  and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance  sheets in the same manner it would record and report  positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.  \n# \nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit  vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities  that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other  projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A  third party is typically the general partner or managing  \nmember and has control over the significant activities of the  tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not  consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in  these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return  primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the  projects.

Refer to  Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further  discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing. \nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases  in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as  deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse  regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the  estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated  fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the  future, which could result in a material impairment charge  to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the  associated goodwill.  \nAs of June   30, 2023, the Firm reviewed current economic  conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as  actual business results and projections of business  performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has  concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June   30,  2023, or December   31, 2022, nor was goodwill written off  due to impairment during the six months ended June   30,  2023 or 2022."

        "text": "# \nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value  considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally  declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing  and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage  loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the  MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.  \nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June   30, 2023 and 2022. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{As of or for the three months} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{As of or for the six months} \\\\\n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{ended June 30,} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{ended June 30,} \\\\\n\\cline{2-7}\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted) & & & & & & \\\\\n\\hline \nFair value at beginning of period & & 2023 & & 2022 & & 2023 & 2022 \\\\\n\\hline \nMSR activity: & \\$ & 7,755 & \\$ & 7,294 & \\$ & \\textbf{7,973} & \\$ & 5,494 \\\\\nOriginations of MSRs & & & & & & & \\\\\nPurchase of MSRs$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & 78 & 181 & 181 & \\textbf{110} & & 596 & & \\\\\nDisposition of MSRs$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & 468 & 160 & 160 & \\textbf{467} & & 875 & & \\\\\n\\hline \nNet additions/(dispositions) & 92 & (92) & (614) & \\textbf{(90)} & (671) & (71) & (10) & 66 \\\\\n\\hline \nChanges due to collection/realization of expected cash flows & 454 & (255) & (273) & \\textbf{487} & 800 & 800 & 100 & 66 \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: & & & (236) & \\textbf{(495)} & (468) & & & \\\\\nChanges due to market interest rates and other$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & & & & & & & \\\\\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: & 283 & 653 & 261 & 1,547 & & & \\\\\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) & 2 & -- & 2 & -- & -- & -- & -- & \\\\\nDiscount rates & -- & -- & -- & -- & -- & -- & -- & \\\\\nPrepayment model changes and other$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & (10) & 1 & 1 & 1 & 66 & 66 & 66 & \\\\\n\\hline \nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions & (8) & 1 & 3 & 66 & 1 & 3 & 66 & \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions} & 275 & 654 & \\textbf{264} & 1,613 & 1,613 & 1,613 & 1,620 & \\\\\n\\hline \nFair value at June 30, & \\$ & 8,229 & \\$ & \\textbf{8,229} & \\$ & 7,439 & \\$ & 7,439 \\\\\n\\hline \nChanges in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income & \\$ & 275 & \\$ & \\textbf{264} & 1 & 10 & 264 & 1,613 \\\\\n\\hline \nContractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income & 388 & 395 & 776 & 765 & 765 & 776 & 765 & \\\\\n\\hline \nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at June 30, (in billions) & 605 & 576 & 605 & 576 & 576 & 605 & 576 & \\\\\n\\hline \nServicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at June 30$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & 595 & 1,166 & 595 & 1,166 & 1,166 & 595 & 1,166 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid within 90 days of  settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.

In each transaction, a portion  of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.

(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a  short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer  advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right  to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if  they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements."

The Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") establishes similar  minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s  principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  \nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines  of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to  maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,  Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet  these minimum requirements could cause the Federal  Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to  these capital requirements established by their respective  primary regulators. \nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory  capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to  which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of  June   30, 2023 and December   31, 2022. \n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{Standardized \\\\ capital ratio}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{Advanced \\\\ capital ratio}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{Well-capitalized \\\\ ratios}} \\\\\n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{requirements}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{capital ratios}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\thead{ratios}} \\\\ \\cmidrule{2-7}\n& BHC$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & IDI$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & BHC$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & IDI$^{(\\mathrc)}$  & BHC$^{(\\mathrc)}$ & IDI$^{(\\mathrc)}$\n\\\\ \\hline \n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{\\thead{\\textbf{Risk-based} capital ratios}} \\\\\n\\textbf{CET1} & & & & & & \\\\\ncapital & 12.5 \\% & 7.0 \\% & 11.0 \\% & 7.0 \\% & NA & 6.5 \\% \\\\\n\\textbf{Tier 1} & & & & & & \\\\\ncapital & 14.0 & 8.5 & 12.5 & 8.5 & 6.0 \\% & 8.0 \\\\\n\\textbf{Total} & & & & & & \\\\\ncapital & 16.0 & 10.5 & 14.5 & 10.5 & 10.0 & 10.0 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the  Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI  subsidiaries are subject.  \nThe following table presents the leverage-based regulatory  capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to  which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of  June   30, 2023 and December   31, 2022. \n\\begin{tabular}{l l l | l l}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Capital ratio} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Well-capitalized}\\\\\n& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{requirements\\textsuperscript{(a)}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{ratios}\\\\\n\\cmidrule{2-5}\n& BHC & IDI & BHC\\textsuperscript{(b)} & IDI\\\\\n\\hline \nLeverage-based capital ratios\\\\\nTier 1 leverage & 4.0 \\% & 4.0 \\% & NA & 5.0 \\% \\\\\nSLR & 5.0 & 6.0 & NA & 6.0 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the  Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI  subsidiaries are subject.

The countercyclical buffer is currently set to   $0\\%$   by the federal banking agencies.\n\n (b) For the period ended December 31, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total  capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to  the Firm were   $12.0\\%$  ,  $13.5\\%$   and   $15.5\\%$  , respectively; the Basel III  Advanced CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio requirements applicable  to the Firm were  $10.5\\%$  ,   $12.0\\%$  , and  $14.0\\%$  , respectively.\n\n (c) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The  CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital  conservation buffer requirement of  $2.5\\%$   that is applicable to the IDI  subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.\n\n (d) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to  regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. \n\n (e) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations  issued under the FDIC Improvement Act."

        "text": "# \nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial  instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address  the financing needs of its customers and clients. The  contractual amount of these financial instruments  represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm  should the customer or client draw upon the commitment  or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the  guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently  fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most  of these commitments and guarantees have historically  been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without  being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total  contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the  Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit  exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of  JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion  of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the  Firm’s related accounting policies.  \nTo provide for expected   credit losses in wholesale and  certain consumer lending-related commitments, an  allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments  is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information  regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related  commitments. \nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts  and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related  financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments  at June   30, 2023, and December   31, 2022. The amounts in  the table below for credit card, home equity and certain  scored business banking lending-related commitments  represent the total available credit for these products. The  Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all  available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at  the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card  and certain scored business banking lines of credit by  providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as  permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm  typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60  days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close  HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of  the underlying property, or when there has been a  demonstrable decline in the credit worthiness of the  borrower."

If the  Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the  Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded  to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by  withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve  accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm  recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment  or performance risk related to charge-backs.  \nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the  characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser  and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives  market.

        "text": "# \n# \nAs of June 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and  affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal  proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government  investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The  litigations range from individual actions involving a single  plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of  class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement  matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by  both governmental agencies and self-regulatory  organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages  of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve  each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies  and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort  and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and  consumer protection claims), some of which present novel  legal theories. \nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of  reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves  established, for its legal proceedings is from   $\\S0$   to  approximately   $\\S1.3$    billion at June 30, 2023. This  estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses  was based upon information available as of that date for  those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an  estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For  certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an  estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate  of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses  involves significant judgment, given:\n\n \n• the number, variety and varying stages of the  proceedings, including the fact that many are in  \npreliminary stages, \n\n • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple  defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability  (if any) has yet to be determined, \n\n • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the  proceedings, including issues regarding class  certification and the scope of many of the claims, and \n\n • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of  such proceedings, including where the Firm has made  assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or  other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of  adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those  assumptions prove to be incorrect. \nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be  a result which the Firm did not take into account in its  estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of  that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s  estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible  losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may  vary significantly. \nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal  proceedings. \n1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a  defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia  by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian  state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan \n\n (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges \n\n “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in  relation to payments of   $\\S300$    million and  $\\S500$    million,  from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB  and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by  1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company  between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.  In September 2022, the Firm filed an application  challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s  jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB  discontinued its claim against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but  requested permission of the Court to refile in the future,  which the Court took under consideration.   \nAmrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is  investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in  connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by  two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase  entities into residential housing projects developed by the  Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”).   In 2017, numerous creditors  filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions  brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or  failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’  petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India  and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order  fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately   $\\S31.5$   million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.  Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued  an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and  other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities  and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,  violated certain currency control and money laundering  provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry  under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)  and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May  2020, the ED attached approximately  $\\S25$   million from J.P.  Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the  criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and  cooperating with the PMLA investigation.    \nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.  The Firm  previously reported settlements with certain government  authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and  trading activities and controls related to those activities.  Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded  guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The  Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions  that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on  the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)"

        "text": "through the ten-year disqualification period following the  antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental  inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter  which is currently pending before the South Africa  Competition Tribunal. \nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New  York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a  consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,  which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws  based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign  exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of  persons who transacted in FX futures and options on  futures. Although certain members of the settlement class  filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an  agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December  2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative  class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange  dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign  currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary  judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023.   Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition,  some FX-related individual and putative class actions based  on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed  outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the  Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve  one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In  July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the  Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for  class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement  in principle has been reached in the putative class action,  which remains subject to court approval.  \nInterchange Litigation.  Groups of merchants and retail  associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging  that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,  conspired to set the price of credit and debit card  interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of  antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases  for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on  appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for  the Eastern District of New York. \nThe original class action was divided into two separate  actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other  seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the  parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement  which amends and supersedes the prior settlement  agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants  collectively contributed an additional  $\\S900$   million to the  approximately   $\\S5.3$   billion previously held in escrow from  the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended  settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.  In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the  Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the  settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for  rehearing of the Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the  percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended  class settlement,  $\\S700$   million has been returned to the  defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with  the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action  continues separately, and in September 2021, the District  Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in  part, and denied the motion in part. \n\nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages  class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions  raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as  well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of  those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached  settlements with the merchants who opted out representing  approximately   $65\\%$   of the combined Mastercard-branded  and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.  \nJeffrey Epstein Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was  named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United  States District Court for the Southern District of New York  alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly  facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other  unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein  until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022,  was a putative class action filed by an alleged sex- trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was  filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the  government of the United States Virgin Islands and also  alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March  2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s motions to dismiss these  complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in both  lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s former  employee, James Edward Staley, into the two lawsuits,  asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of  fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant  doctrine. In May 2023, the Court denied Staley’s motion to  dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court  granted the putative class’ motion for class certification and  granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the  class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay  $\\S_{ Ḋ }290 Ḍ$    million to a fund  for Epstein survivors. The actions involving the government  of the United States Virgin Islands and Staley are  proceeding.  \nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and  Litigation.  JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from  various governmental agencies and entities around the  world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s  (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for  various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s  Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss  Competition Commission’s investigation relating to  EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain  subject, continues. In December 2016, the European  Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other  banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules  relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that  decision with the European General Court, and that appeal  is pending."

        "text": "In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along  with other banks in various individual and putative class  actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar  LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the  period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has  obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain  other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of  New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims  related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the  defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative  class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was  administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been  dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a  lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and  other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement  to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the  market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In  September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint  in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint  asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have  moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class  actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and  the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill  Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in  November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss  franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. \nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,  Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are  named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New  York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust  law and New York State common law in connection with an  alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous  exchange trading for securities lending transactions.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.  Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which  defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an  agreement in principle to settle this action, subject to final  documentation and court approval. \nShareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class  actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting  to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the  Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and  former officers.   \nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical  trading practices by former employees in the precious  metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct  which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the  DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary  activities that were separately the subject of a resolution  between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in  November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits  was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in  May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust  enrichment claims relating to the historical trading  practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which  were the subject of the resolutions described above. In  December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to  dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff  filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second  shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States  District Court for the Eastern District of New York in  December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices  and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty  and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is  excused from making a demand to commence litigation  because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants  have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a  consolidated putative class action is pending in the United  States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on  behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan  Chase common stock during the putative class period,  alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially  false or misleading because they did not disclose certain  information relating to the historical trading practices and  conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended  complaint in this action.  \n\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March  2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern  District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty  and violations of federal securities laws based on the  alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise  adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records  preservation requirements which were the subject of  resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and  the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the  amended complaint is pending. \nTwo shareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June  2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for  the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of  fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged  failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to  exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm’s  provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These  actions allege that the shareholders are excused from  making a demand to commence litigation because such a  demand would have been futile. These actions were  consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the  amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs.  \nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed  above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as  defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial  number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has  meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its  currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to  defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may  be initiated from time to time in the future. \nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its  currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with  the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm  accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable  that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of  the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its  outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its  litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,  upward or downward, as appropriate, based on  management’s best judgment after consultation with  counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was  $\\S420$   million and   $\\S73$   million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and  2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s  litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future."

        "text": "In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome  of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek  very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters  present novel legal theories, involve a large number of  parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot  state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of  the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate  resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or  consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase  believes, based upon its current knowledge and after  consultation with counsel, consideration of the material  legal proceedings described above and after taking into  account its current litigation reserves and its estimated  aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal  proceedings currently pending against it should not have a  material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial  condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the  uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no  assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will  not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently  accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational  consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular  matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating  results for a particular period, depending on, among other  factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level  of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period."

        "text": "# \nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major  reportable business segments - Consumer & Community  Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial  Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there  is a Corporate segment. The business segments are  determined based on the products and services provided, or  the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in  which financial information is currently evaluated by the  Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented  on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and  Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further  discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. \n# \nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s  segment results as of or for the three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s  definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.  GAAP results and includes certain reclassification s to  present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the  reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.  \nAccordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax  credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the  managed results on a basis comparable to taxable  investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan  Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the  Firm’s managed basis.  \n# \nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is  referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions,  judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are  reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the  LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated  its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact  of the First Republic acquisition.

        "text": "# \nOn May   1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets  and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the  \"First Republic acquisition\") from the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver, for  $\\S67.9$    billion, resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of   $\\S2.7$   billion recorded in other income. The estimated  bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the  estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the  purchase price. The First Republic acquisition further  advances the Firm's wealth management strategy and is  complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. \nThe Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a  business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the  initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair  values as of May   1, 2023. The determination of those fair  values required management to make certain market-based  assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount  rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the  acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates  of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a  reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain  purchase gain.  \nAs part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a  five-year,   $\\S50$   billion secured note to the FDIC (the  \"Purchase Money Note\"). The Purchase Money Note bears  interest at a fixed rate of   $3.4\\%$   and is secured by certain of  the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable  upon notice to the FDIC. \nThe Firm had placed a   $\\S5$   billion deposit with First Republic  Bank on March   16, 2023, as part of  $\\S30$   billion of deposits  provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's   $\\S5$  billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the  acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses  was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid  the remaining  $\\S25$   billion of deposits to the consortium of  banks, including accrued interest through the payment date  on May   9, 2023. \nThe Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the  settlement process under which the purchase price, and the  identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,  will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process  may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase  gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into  with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a  year after the acquisition date.  \nIn addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain  purchase gain could change pending management's  finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for  certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (such  as loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases),  which may take place up to one year from the acquisition  date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. \nIn connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm  and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with  respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments  (the \"shared-loss assets\"): the Commercial Shared-Loss  Agreement (\"CSLA\") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss  Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers  $80\\%$   of credit  losses, on a pari-passu basis, over 5 years with a  subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired  commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The  SFSLA covers  $80\\%$   of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis,  for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages  on real property or shares in cooperative property  constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets  which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA are  reflected in the total assets acquired."

Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented  investment liabilities of  $\\S669$    million and lease liabilities of  $\\S756$   million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 17 for additional information. \nThe issuance of the  $\\S50$    billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's   $\\S5$    billion deposit and   $\\S447$    million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the  $\\S3.7$    billion payable to the FDIC as part of the purchase  price consideration are considered non-cash transactions. \nThe following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the following  assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the  related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. \nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies for  securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments. \nCore deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer  relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First  Republic transaction. The core deposit intangible of  $\\S1.3$    billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost  savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using  the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost  savings were estimated based on the difference between  the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the  cost of next best alternative funding sources available to  market participants. The customer relationship intangibles  of   $\\S187$   million were valued by discounting estimated after- tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the  multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset  valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a  market participant would use to estimate fair values, such  as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well  as related costs to service the relationships, and discount  rates. The core deposit and customer relationship  intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of  future cash flows of approximately 7 years.

Under certain circumstances, the  Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon  termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the  level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss  assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected  as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price  consideration. \nPurchase Money Note and FHLB advances \nThe Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on  the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the  Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted  cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market  discount rates.   \nThe FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded  in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair  value of the FHLB advances was based on a discounted cash  flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB  advance issuance rates. \nLoans The following table presents the unpaid principal balance and estimated fair value of the loans acquired as of May 1, 2023. \n\\begin{tabular}{lrrr}\n\\hline \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{May 1, 2023} \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n(in millions) & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{UPB} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Fair value} \\\\\n\\hline \nResidential real estate & \\$ & 106,240 & \\$ & 91,906 \\\\\nAuto and other & 3,092 & 2,031 &  &  \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total consumer} & 109,332 & 93,937 \\\\\n\\hline \nSecured by real estate & 37,119 & 33,605 \\\\\nCommercial \\& industrial & 4,333 & 3,933 \\\\\nOther & 22,597 & 20,860 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total wholesale} & 64,049 & 58,398 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Total loans} & 173,381 & 152,335 \\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\nUnaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information   Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net income  contributed by First Republic since the acquisition date of May 1, 2023 of   $\\S3.1$    billion,  $\\S897$    million and  $\\S2.4$    billion,  respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. \nThe following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended June 30,  2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated  bargain purchase gain of  $\\S2.7$   billion and the provision for credit losses of  $\\S1.2$    billion.

Based on our reviews, we are not  aware of any material modifications that should be made to  the accompanying interim financial statements for them to  be in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America. \nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the  standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of  the Firm as of December   31, 2022, and the related  consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,  changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the  year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report  dated February 21, 2023, which included a paragraph  describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit  losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated  financial statements. In our opinion, the information set  forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  information as of December   31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all  material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance  sheet from which it has been derived.   \n# \nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of  the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm  registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be  independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with  the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and  regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and  the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with  the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial  information consists principally of applying analytical  procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for  financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in  scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the  standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the  expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements  taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an  opinion. \n\nAugust   3, 2023"

The minimum payment on an option  ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the  introductory period. This introductory rate is usually  significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed  rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once  the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate  charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and  adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The  minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest  accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is  deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.  Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which  converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan  upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date  triggers."

The Firm believes that this  financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a  lending institution to generate income in excess of its  provision for credit losses. \nPrincipal transactions revenue :   Principal transactions  revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer  spread, which is the difference between the price at which  the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and  the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.  It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or  termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and  unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and  losses on financial and other instruments (including those  accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in  client-driven market-making activities and on private equity  investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity  instruments, derivatives and commodities (including  physical commodities inventories and financial instruments  that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue  also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and  losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives  designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships  (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign  exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk  management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and  foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.  \nPSU(s) : Performance share units  \nRegulatory VaR:  Daily aggregated VaR calculated in  accordance with regulatory rules. \nREO:  Real estate owned \nReported basis:  Financial statements prepared under U.S.  GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent  adjustments. \nRetained loans :   Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e.  excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). \nRevenue wallet:  Total fee revenue based on estimates of  investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e.,  the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions  in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan  syndications.

Otherwise, there was no change in the Firm’s internal control  over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during  the three months ended June   30, 2023, that has materially  affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the  Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.  \nPart II – Other Information \n# \nRefer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal  proceedings in Note 26 of this Form 10-Q for information  that updates the disclosures set forth under Part   I, Item   3:  Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. \n# \nThe following discussion supplements the discussion of risk  factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk  Factors on pages 9-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K  and Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form  10-Q. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets  forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan  Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should  not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a  complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. \n# \nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain   assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank  from the FDIC (the “First Republic acquisition”). There can be  no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the  anticipated positive results, including with respect to:\n\n \n• the total cost of integration\n\n • the time required to complete the integration\n\n • the amount of longer-term cost savings\n\n • the overall performance of the assets and liabilities  acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or\n\n • an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock. \nIntegration of an acquired business can be complex and  costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant  accounting and data processing systems and management  controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with  employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.  Integration efforts could divert management attention and  resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s  operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could  incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the  First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts. \nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that  cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or  cause clients and customers to move their business to  competing financial institutions. It is possible that the  integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing  businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls,  procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan  Chase’s ability to maintain relationships with clients,  customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of  key employees in connection with the First Republic  acquisition   could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to  successfully conduct its business. \n# \nRefer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 4–8  of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for information on  Supervision and Regulation. \n# \nThe Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity  securities during the three months ended June   30, 2023. \nRepurchases under the common share repurchase program Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of this  Form 10-Q and pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022  Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the  Firm’s common share repurchase program. \nThe Firm is authorized to purchase up to  $\\S30$    billion under  its common share repurchase program previously approved  by the Board of Directors."

Disclosure may be  required even where the activities, transactions or dealings  were conducted in compliance with applicable law. As of the  date of this report, the Firm is not aware of any activity,  transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during the  quarter ended June 30, 2023 that requires disclosure  under Section 219. \nDuring the first quarter of 2023, a foreign-incorporated  subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. processed a transaction  in the amount of EUR 9.90 for its client, a non-U.S.  subsidiary of a U.S. insurance provider, where the  transaction originated from an external account held by an  individual designated under 31 C.F.R. Part 594.  The  transaction, which was received into the client’s account  held at the foreign-incorporated subsidiary of JPMorgan  Chase & Co., was for the premium of a non-life insurance  product that is now suspended and no funds were made  available to the designated individual. The transaction was  processed in error. JPMorgan Chase & Co. charged a fee of   $\\S0.006$   for this transaction.
