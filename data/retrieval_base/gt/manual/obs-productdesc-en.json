        "text": "About OBS\n\n\nOBS Overview\n\nObject Storage Service (OBS) is a scalable service that provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud storage for massive amounts of data.\n\nOBS provides unlimited storage capacity for objects of any format, catering to the needs of common users, websites, enterprises, and developers. There is no limitation on the storage capacity of the entire OBS system or of a single bucket, and any number of objects can be stored. As a web service, OBS supports APIs over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). You can use OBS Console or OBS tools to access and manage data stored in OBS anytime, anywhere. With OBS SDKs and APIs, you can easily manage data stored in OBS and develop upper-layer applications.\n\nHuawei Cloud deploys OBS infrastructures in multiple regions across the globe, delivering high scalability and reliability. You can deploy OBS in specific regions for faster access at an affordable price.\n\nProduct Architecture\n\nOBS basically consists of buckets and objects.\nA bucket is a container for storing objects in OBS. Each bucket is specific to a region and has specific storage class and access permissions. A bucket is accessible through its access domain name over the Internet.\n\nAn object is the fundamental storage unit in OBS. An object consists of the following:\n- A key that specifies the name of an object. An object key is aTF-8 string up to 1,024 characters long. Each object is uniquely identified by a key within a bucket.\n- Metadata that describes an object. The metadata is a set of key-value pairs that are assigned to objects stored in OBS. There are two types of metadata: system-defined metadata and custom metadata.\n- $\\quad$ System-defined metadata is automatically assigned by OBS for processing objects. Such metadata includes Date, Content-Length, Last-Modified, ETag, and more."

        "text": "Object Storage Service\nProduct Introduction\n1 About OBS\n- You can specify custom metadata to describe the object when you upload an object to OBS.\n- Data that refers to the content of an object.\n\nBy means of secondary development based on OBS REST APIs, OBS Console, SDKs, and a variety of tools are provided for you to use OBS. You can also use OBS SDKs and APIs to develop applications customized for your business needs.\n\nFigure 1-1 Product architecture\n\nStorage Classes\nOBS offers the storage classes below to meet your requirements for storage performance and costs. You can change buckets and objects between storage classes. To learn billing for different storage classes, see Storage Space.\n- Standard: The Standard storage class features low latency and high throughput. It is therefore good for storing frequently (multiple times per month) accessed files or small files (less than 1 MB ). Its application scenarios include big data analytics, mobile apps, hot videos, and social apps.\n- Infrequent Access: The Infrequent Access storage class is for storing data that is infrequently (less than 12 times per year) accessed, but when needed, the access has to be fast. It can be used for file synchronization, file sharing, enterprise backups, and many other scenarios. This storage class has the same durability, low latency, and high throughput as the Standard storage class, with a lower cost, but its availability is slightly lower than the Standard storage class.\n- Archive: The Archive storage class is ideal for storing data that is rarely (once per year) accessed. Its application scenarios include data archive and longterm backups. This storage class is secure, durable, and inexpensive, so it can be used to replace tape libraries. To keep cost low, it may take hours to restore data from the Archive storage class.\nIssue 26 (2024-02-28)\nCopyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\n2"

        "text": "- Deep Archive: The Deep Archive storage class (under limited beta testing) is suitable for storing data that is barely (once every few years) accessed. This storage class costs less than the Archive storage class, but takes longer time (usually several hours) to restore data.\n\nAn object uploaded to a bucket inherits the storage class of the bucket by default. You can also specify a storage class for an object when you upload it.\n\nChanging the storage class of a bucket does not change the storage classes of existing objects in the bucket, but newly uploaded objects will inherit the new storage class.\n\nTable 1-1 Comparison between storage classes\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nCompared \\\\\nItem\n\\end{tabular} & Standard & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nInfrequent \\\\\nAccess\n\\end{tabular} & Archive & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nDeep Archive \\\\\n(Under \\\\\nLimited Beta \\\\\nTesting\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  Feature & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nTop-notch \\\\\nperformance \\\\\nhigh \\\\\nreliability \\\\\nand \\\\\navailability\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nReliable, \\\\\ninexpensive \\\\\nstorage with \\\\\nreal-time \\\\\naccess\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nLong-term \\\\\nretention of \\\\\narchived data \\\\\nat a low cost\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nLower price \\\\\nthan the \\\\\nArchive \\\\\nstorage class \\\\\nfor long-term \\\\\ndata archive.\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nApplication \\\\\nscenarios\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nCloud \\\\\napplication, \\\\\ndata sharing, \\\\\ncontent \\\\\nsharing, and \\\\\nhot data \\\\\nstorage\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nWeb disk \\\\\napplications, \\\\\nenterprise \\\\\nbackup, active \\\\\narchiving, and \\\\\ndata \\\\\nmonitoring\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nArchive, \\\\\nmedical \\\\\nimage \\\\\nstorage, video \\\\\nmaterial \\\\\nstorage, and \\\\\nreplacement \\\\\nof tape \\\\\nlibraries\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nArchiving data \\\\\nthat is barely \\\\\naccessed.\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nDesigned \\\\\ndurability\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.99999999 \\\\\n9\\%\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.999999999 \\\\\n\\%\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.999999999 \\\\\n\\%\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.999999999 \\\\\n$\\%$\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nDesigned \\\\\ndurability \\\\\n(multi-AZ)\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.99999999 \\\\\n99\\%\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l}\n99.999999999 \\\\\n9\\%\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nMulti-AZ not \\\\\nsupported\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nMulti-AZ not \\\\\nsupported\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nDesigned \\\\\navailability\n\\end{tabular} & $99.99 \\%$ & $99 \\%$ & 99\\% & $99 \\%$ \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nDesigned \\\\\navailability \\\\\n(multi-AZ)\n\\end{tabular} & $99.995 \\%$ & $99.5 \\%$ & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nMulti-AZ not \\\\\nsupported\n\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}{l} \nMulti-AZ not \\\\\nsupported\n\\end{tabular} \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{l} \nMinimum \\\\\nstorage \\\\\nduration\n\\end{tabular} & N/A & 30 days & 90 days & 180 days \\\\\n \n\\end{tabular}"

No matter which method you use, you are accessing OBS over the REST API.\n\nOBS REST APIs support both authenticated and anonymous requests. There will usually be anonymous requests in the scenarios that require public access, for example, accessing a hosted static website. In most cases, requests for OBS resources must be authenticated. An authenticated request must include a signature. The signature is calculated based on the requester's access keys (a pair of AK and SK) that are used as the encryption factor and the specific information included in the request body. OBS uses an access key ID (AK) and a secret access key (SK) together to authenticate the identity of a requester. For more information, see Access Keys (AK/SK).\n\nOther OBS access scenarios include:\n- Accessing OBS Using Permanent Access Keys\n- Accessing OBS Using Temporary Access Keys\n- Accessing OBS Using a Temporary URL\n- Accessing OBS Using an IAM Agency\n\nAccess Control\nOBS access control can be implemented based on IAM permissions, bucket policies, ACLs, URL validation, and CORS.\nIssue 26 (2024-02-28)\nCopyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\n28"

OBS permissions are assigned to users in the global project, and users do not need to switch regions when accessing OBS.\n\nYou can grant users permissions by using roles or policies.\n- Roles: A type of coarse-grained authorization mechanism that provides only a limited number of service-level roles. When using roles to grant permissions, you also need to assign dependency roles. However, roles are not an ideal choice for fine-grained authorization and secure access control.\n- Policies: A type of fine-grained authorization mechanism that defines permissions required to perform operations on specific cloud resources under certain conditions. This mechanism allows for more flexible policy-based authorization for secure access control. For example, you can grant OBS users only the permissions for managing a certain type of OBS resources.

        "text": "Basic Concepts\n\n\n9.1 Objects\n\nObjects are basic units stored in OBS. An object contains both data and the metadata that describes data attributes. Data uploaded to OBS is stored in buckets as objects.\n\nAn object consists of the following:\n- A key that specifies the name of an object. An object key is a UTF-8 string up to 1,024 characters long. Each object is uniquely identified by a key within a bucket.\n- Metadata that describes an object. The metadata is a set of key-value pairs that are assigned to objects stored in OBS. There are two types of metadata: system-defined metadata and custom metadata.\n- System-defined metadata is automatically assigned by OBS for processing objects. Such metadata includes Date, Content-Length, Last-Modified, ETag, and more.\n- You can specify custom metadata to describe the object when you upload an object to OBS.\n- Data that refers to the content of an object.\n\nGenerally, objects are managed as files. However, OBS is an object-based storage service and there is no concept of files and folders. For easy data management, OBS provides a method to simulate folders. By adding a slash (/) to an object name, for example, test/123.jpg, you can specify test as a folder and 123.jpg as the name of a file in the test folder. The key of the object is test/123.jpg.\n\nWhen uploading an object, you can set a storage class for the object. If no storage class is specified, the object is stored in the same storage class as the bucket in which it resides. You can also change the storage class of an existing object in a bucket.\n\nOn OBS Console and OBS Browser+, you can use folders the same way you use them in a file system.\n\nFor details about object operations, see Managing Objects."

        "text": "Object Storage Service\nProduct Introduction\n9 Basic Concepts\n9.2 Buckets\n\nBuckets are containers for storing objects. OBS provides flat storage in the form of buckets and objects. Unlike the conventional multi-layer directory structure of file systems, all objects in a bucket are stored at the same logical layer.\n\nEach bucket has its own attributes, such as access permissions, storage class, and the region. You can specify access permissions, storage class, and regions when creating buckets. You can also configure advanced attributes to meet storage requirements in different scenarios.\n\nOBS provides the following storage classes for buckets: Standard, Infrequent Access, Archive, and Deep Archive (under limited beta testing). With support for these storage classes, OBS caters to diverse storage performance and cost requirements. When creating a bucket, you can specify a storage class for it, which can be changed later.\n\nEach bucket name in OBS is globally unique and cannot be changed after the bucket has been created. The region where a bucket resides cannot be changed once the bucket is created. When you create a bucket, OBS creates a default access control list (ACL) that grants users permissions (such as read and write permissions) on the bucket. Only authorized users can perform operations such as creating, deleting, viewing, and configuring buckets.\n\nAn account (including all IAM users under this account) can create a maximum of 100 buckets and parallel file systems. However, there is no restriction on the number and total size of objects in a bucket.\n\nOBS adopts the REST architectural style, and is based on HTTP and HTTPS. You can use URLs to locate resources.\n\nFigure 9-1 illustrates the relationship between buckets and objects in OBS.\nFigure 9-1 Relationship between objects and buckets\n\nFor details about bucket operations, see Managing Buckets.\nIssue 26 (2024-02-28)\nCopyright (c) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.\n52"

It features access latency in milliseconds, $T B / s$-level bandwidth, and millions of IOPS, which makes it ideal for processing high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.\n\nIt also supports data read and write through obsfs, a PFS client that supports POSIX. obsfs can be deployed on a Linux ECS, and then you can use obsfs to mount a parallel file system to that server. Once mounted, PFS functions like a local file system. You can manage the PFS online, including creating, deleting, renaming files and folders, or modifying files.\nFor details about PFS, see the Parallel File System Feature Guide.\n\n9.4 Access Keys (AK/SK)\n\nOBS uses an access key ID (AK) and secret access key (SK) to authenticate the identity of a requester. When you use OBS APIs for secondary development and use the AK and SK for authentication, the signature must be calculated based on the algorithm defined by OBS and added to the request.\nThe authentication can be based on a permanent AK and SK pair, or based on a temporary AK/SK pair and security token.\n\nPermanent AK/SK Pair\n\nYou can create a pair of permanent AK and SK on the My Credentials page. For details, see Obtaining Access Keys (AK and SK).\n- Access key ID (AK): indicates the ID of the access key. It is the unique ID associated with the SK. The AK and SK are used together to obtain an encrypted signature for a request.\n- Secret access key (SK): indicates the private key used together with its associated AK to cryptographically sign requests. The AK and SK are used together to identify a request sender to prevent the request from being modified.\n\nTemporary AK/SK Pair\n\nA temporary AK/SK pair and security token assigned by OBS comply with the principle of least privilege and are for temporarily accessing OBS. They are valid from 15 minutes to 24 hours, and need to be obtained again once they expire. If the security token is missing from your request, a 403 error will be returned.\n- Temporary AK: indicates the ID of a temporary access key. It is the unique ID associated with the SK. The AK and SK are used together to obtain an encrypted signature for a request.\n- Temporary SK: indicates the temporary private key used together with its associated temporary AK. The AK and SK are used together to identify a request sender to prevent the request from being modified.\n- Security token: indicates the token used together with the temporary AK and SK to access all resources of a specified account."

An endpoint is considered a domain name to access OBS in a region and is used to process requests of that region. For details about regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints.\n\nBucket domain name: Each bucket in OBS has a domain name. A domain name is the address of a bucket and can be used to access the bucket over the Internet. It is applicable to cloud application development and data sharing.\n\nAn OBS bucket domain name is in the format of BucketName.Endpoint, where BucketName indicates the name of the bucket, and Endpoint indicates the domain name of the region where the bucket is located.\n\nTable 9-2 lists the bucket domain name and other domain names in OBS, including their structure and protocols."

You can create resources in a specific region and $A Z$.\n- Regions are classified based on geographical location and network latency. Public services, such as Elastic Cloud Server (ECS), Elastic Volume Service (EVS), Object Storage Service (OBS), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic IP (EIP), and Image Management Service (IMS), are shared within the same region. Regions are classified as universal regions and dedicated regions. A universal region provides universal cloud services for common tenants. A dedicated region provides services of the same type or only provides services for specific tenants.\n- An AZ contains one or more physical data centers. Each AZ has independent cooling, fire extinguishing, moisture-proofing, and electricity facilities. Within an AZ, computing, network, storage, and other resources are logically divided into multiple clusters. AZs within a region are interconnected using highspeed optical fibers to allow you to build cross-AZ high-availability systems.\nFigure 9-2 shows the relationship between the regions and AZs."

You can select a region and AZ according to your requirement. For more information, see Huawei Cloud Global Regions.\n\nHow Do I Select a Region?\nWhen selecting a region, consider the following factors:\n- Location\n\nSelect a region close to you or your target users. This reduces network latency and improves access speed. However, Chinese mainland regions provide the same infrastructure, BGP network quality, as well as resource operations and configurations. If you or your target users are in the Chinese mainland, you do not need to consider differences in network latency when selecting a region.\n- If you or your target users are in the Asia Pacific region (excluding the Chinese mainland), select regions such as AP-Bangkok and AP-Singapore.\n- If you or your target users are in Africa, select the AF-Johannesburg region.\n- If you or your target users are in Europe, select the EU-Paris region.\n- Resource prices\n\nResource prices may vary depending on different regions. For details, see Product Pricing Details.\n\nHow Do I Select an AZ?\nWhen determining whether to deploy resources in the same $A Z$, consider your applications' requirements for disaster recovery (DR) and network latency.\n- For high DR capability, deploy resources in different AZs in the same region.\n- For low network latency, deploy resources in the same AZ.\n\nRegions and Endpoints\nBefore using an API to call resources, you must specify its region and endpoint.
